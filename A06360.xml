            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But what doe I doe? I dare not giue ſayle into the Ocean of your vaſt

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>REGORY Lopes was borne at Madrid, in the yeare of our Lord
1542. on the fourth of Iulie vpon which day was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at that time the
feaſt of S. Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neocaeſarea in Pontus but
ſince is transferred to the 17. of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember. He was baptized in the Parish
of S. Giles and was named Gregory by his Parents, becauſe he was borne vpon
that day.</p>
               <p>This is all that is knowne and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be auerred of his linage,
houſe, and name, for thoſe that were <pb n="4" facs="tcp:5694:7"/>moſt inward with
him, were of opinion that Lopes was not his owne, but rather that the holy man
had aſſumed it the better to conceale his noble family. For there appeared
in his behauiour, a certaine generoſity vnder that humble grauity, and that
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſpirite and reſolurion: in what buſines ſoeuer, a
reſpect, and courteſy ſo acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated to euery ones quality, as all were
perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he was deſcended of a noble houſe.</p>
               <p>None could euer heare from his owne mouth, what he was, for
being asked by ſome graue perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, and ſuch as were moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with him, who he was, and of what country, he anſwered: what auaileth that?
Father Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Loſa a great ſeruant of God, who had, bin Curate of the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall of Mexico, and left all to accompany and conuerſe with holy
Gregory, and to cherish and tende him (as he did vntill his <pb n="5" facs="tcp:5694:7"/>death) treating of the ſame thing in the booke which he did write of
his life, and how he had earneſtly intreated him ſome few daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his
death, that he would tell him who were his Parents, he affirmeth, that he made
anſwer only in theſe wordes. ſince I came into the field to lead a
ſolitary life I haue held only God for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; my brethren by this time
are dead, of whom I was they ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt. Such was his ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in this, though
remarkeable in all things.</p>
               <p>It is probable that he had his calling euen from his childhood,
becauſe Father Loſa askeing him vpon an occaſion if God began to
diſpoſe him for his ſeruice, as ſoone as he had the vſe of reaſon,
he ſaid he knew not certainely whether it was then or a little after, but
that he was certaine that our Lord had called him very ſoone, and that he
neuer was a chid in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo he was wont to ſay, as one that
had found it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience <pb n="6" facs="tcp:5694:8"/>in himſelf, that which the holy
Ghoſt ſaid by Hieremy, that the man was happy that caried the yoake of our
Lord from his youth.</p>
               <p>In his childhood he did learne to reade, and write, wherein he
became ſo excellent, as that ſome things which he hath left writen with his
owne hands ſeeme to be printed, he did neuer ſtudy Latine, nor any
ſcience, ſo that whoſoeuer did heare him treate of many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities both
naturall and diuine, ſo clearely and diſtinctly as he did, might eaſily
gather that without doubt he had no other Maſter but God.</p>
               <p>He had a deſire euen almoſt from his infanty, to liue
à ſolitary life far from his parents, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being very young,
he went to Burgos, and from thence to Nauarre; and liued ſix yeares vpon a
mountaine in the company of an hermire, in great pouerty obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and
humility, till at lenth, God ſo permitting, his Father we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <pb n="7" facs="tcp:5694:8"/>to ſeeke him, and finding him out, brought him to Valladolid where at
that time was the court of Spaine, and there placed him with a Gentleman of
good account, to ſerue as his page, much againſt Gregory his will: but
neither the braueries nor faſſions of the court could make him forgett God,
and his inward recollection, where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he perceiued his calling was, and he
was wont to ſay that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he ſerued in that place, and was ſent
vpon errandes, his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt care was to goe talkeing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally with God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly groweing in yeares and haueing attained the twentieth
yeare of his age or ther abouts: and (as much as may be gathered) his father
and Mother being now dead, he reſolued vpon that which he had allwaies
determined and purpoſed in his mind, and taking with him ſome little things
which were neceſſary for ſuch a long voiage, he tooke his iourney
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb n="8" facs="tcp:5694:9"/>Siuill, with intent to take ship for the indies,
viſiting ſome holy places which are in the way in Caſtile, and Andalutia;
he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Toledo, where whileſt he praied in the great Church and
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited many Reliques, and pictures that are there, he confeſſed that
one day amongſt the reſt God did him, in that place, ſuch a ſpeciall
fauour and grace as he had neuer receaued the like till that time, but he would
neuer tell what ir was.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of Guadalupe, where he
ſpent ſome daies in watching, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer, beſeeching that
glorious Virgin the guid of the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that ſhe woud obtaine of her
bleſſed ſonne to enlighten him in his iourney which he purpoſed: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it
is certainely thought, as much as could be gathered by that little which he
declared (for he did not reueale his thoughts to any body) that the Mother of
God at Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalupe <pb n="9" facs="tcp:5694:9"/>commanded him by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reuelation,
to goe to new Spaine, which iourney he tooke in hand and performed very

ſomwhat of his mind and purpoſe in coming to the Indies, becauſe moſt
Men goe thither to increaſe their fortunes, and he, it ſeemes, had read
that which S. Auguſtine ſaith in one of his Epiſtles: if you would be a
good Marchant, and heape vp ſtore of wealth, giue that which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep, and you shall receiue in exchange, that which you cannot looſe, giue a
little and you shall receaue a great deale, becauſe for theſe temporall
goods, which you diſtribute, there shall be giuen you an eternall
inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: ſo he being furnished with cloaths, mony, and ſome other
little things to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of eightſcore pound ſtarling, he gaue away a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
diſtributed it all, for the loue of God keeping no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for himſelf but
what was neceſſary to couer his body, which was a ſute of ordinary cloath
of rash, with which he went from <pb n="11" facs="tcp:5694:10"/>the City of Veractuz to
Mexico, trauailing, thoſe 240. miles with many incommodities in his
ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, becauſe he neuer asked any thing of any body, neither for
Gods ſake, nor for any other reſpect.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as he came to Mexico, being, as is ſaid, before
excellent in the art of writing: leaſt he should giue himſelf any
occaſion to be withdrawne, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his purpoſe neuer ſo little, he did flie
idlenes (becauſe as the poet Lucan ſaith, that is the effect of idlenes)
and he ſetled himſelf to write firſt with a Scriuener by name San Roman
and afterwards with the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Turcius; it was Lent at that time he was in
Mexico and he faſted it all with bread and water, and with the greateſt
abſtinence, ſilence, and auſterities as was euer ſeeene in any
ſecular Man: And this is manifeſt by à letter which Leues Zapata
writ vnto him about 29. or 30. yeares afterwards, which came to be in the yeare
of our <pb n="12" facs="tcp:5694:11"/>Lord 1591. It is dated from the Mines of Iaxio and
writen vnto Gregory Lopes who was then in Santafe in great eſteeme for his
ſanctitie as shall be ſayd hereafter. The tenour of the letter is this.</p>
               <p>About 29. or 30. yeares agoe whileſt that I dwelt in the
ſtreet of Tabuſa in Mexico, there came out of Spaine, and lodged in my
houſe a Gentleman cloathed in rash, and amongſt other tokens, he faſted
that Lent with bread, and water, he was called Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lopes: they ſay that
you are called ſoe, I pray doe me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to write if you be he, and to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me to God in your prayres.</p>
               <p>And that he was, the ſame, it is manifeſt by his anſwer,
which he ſent back in the ſame paper in theſe onely words: I am he that
you ſpeake of, I will doe as you requeſt me. A ſentence worthy of ſo
great a perſonage; a wiſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and of great moment, to teach the
profane cuſtome of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <pb n="13" facs="tcp:5694:11"/>age, to ſpare their
wordes and paper.</p>
               <p>Gregory Lopes ſtaid in Mexico, onely till he could gett by his
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, where withall to paſſe to Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrias whether he had a mind to
goe; as ſoone as he came to thoſe mines, and ſaw, the confuſion and
couetouſnes, thoſe wranglings, oaths, and periuries, the ſuites in law,
quarrells and misfortunes of thoſe Men ſo drowned in auarice, by reaſon
of that Minerall, he was much diſcontented, and great was the diſlike that
he had whileſt he was there, eſpecially when one day he ſaw with his owne
eyes, that, at ſuch time, as the Cartes went away with the ſiluer to
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xico, two men,, which ſeemed to be diſcreet, fell out about a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
intereſt, and killed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſame time without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to giue
account, either of the goods to the owners, their ſoules to God, which was
the greater loſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:5694:12"/>This troubled Gregory very much, being
ſory for the loſſe of thoſe two ſoules a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d being inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtricken
he trembled with feare to ſee how much God was offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in that place, and
how eaſily Men went to hell. From that time, he begane to make more haſt,
to put that in practiſe, which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his mind, namely to goe
and liue in the wildernes ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, fearing, leaſt delay might be
hurtfull, ſince that the ſtaying of Eſau in hunting made him looſe his
fathers bleſſing: and it is the opinion of wiſe Men, that in war and in
the way of vertue, delay is for the moſt part hurtfull with this
reſolution, he changed thoſe cloaths he wore, which were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
good, for a ſack cloth, and went 24. mile farther into the Country, to the
Valley of Amvac, amongſt the Chichimecos, whoſe crueltic was in thoſe
time much feared by the Spaniards, becauſe they did eate Mans fleshe, and 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5694:12"/>committed many other cruelties: but he hauing God in his
heart, feared no man, and ſo it came to paſſe that theſe Men, or
beaſts (for ſoe they shewed themſelues to others) were ſo courteous to
him as that they helped him to make è little cottage after the manner of
an Hermitage, which we may well ſay, was the firſt that euer, was in new
Spaine with that name.</p>

               <head>THE THIRD CHAPTER. <hi>Of the ſolitary life which he began
to lead in the Valley of Amayac amongſt the Chichimecos.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>GRegory Lopes began his ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life as he was entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the one and twentieth yeare of his age, which is a matter of great importance,
to wit, to begin euen from ones youth thoſe exerciſes, which are to
continue all ones life, and S. Ambroſe ſaid, that this was the honour of
young Men, to <pb n="16" facs="tcp:5694:13"/>learne the feare of God from their tender
years. Therfore the firſt thing, that Gregory did, for the better performance
of this his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life, was to make the two firſt ſteps, the one with
the feare, the other, with the loue of God, offering himſelf vp ito his
hands, and putting himſelf vnder the shadow of his moſt aſſured
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, with theſe wordes. Lord here I goe forth onely to ſerue thee,
and not for any intereſt of mine owne; if I doe perisheth, on thy account be
it. By Gods fault no Man perisheth, becauſe he giueth euery one, that, which
is ſufficient, if he will make his benefit of it for his ſaluation. And our
ruine all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proceedeth, and is cauſed by ourſelues as all the holy
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe vnderſtand and as may be gathered by many places of the holy
Scripture, eſpecially by the wordes of the Prophet Iſaie in the 13.
Chapter. <hi>Thy perdition O Iſraell is thy owne worke, from me only 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5694:13"/>thou hadſt help</hi> that thou mightſt not haue bin
deſtroied, if thou wouldſt haue helped thy ſelf with it. So Gregory by
thoſe wordes did not meane, that his ſoule might be loſt for want of Gods
aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he himſelf doing, what lay in him becauſe that cannot be
imagined of a Man endued naturally, with ſuch an vnderſtanding, and
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally with ſo much light, but, by this manner of ſpeech, he
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to declare his affection: and truely wordes comming from hearts
enkindled with loue are alwaies to be piouſly interpreted, conformably to the
affection which doth then rule in them.</p>
               <p>Here by we might gather the nature of this act of Gregory, which
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from two apprehenſions which he might haue had of God at that
time. The firſt was, of a holy feare of the combates which offer themſelues
in the deſert; the which proceeded out of a perfect knowledge, which God had
giuen, <pb n="18" facs="tcp:5694:14"/>him, of his owne weaknes. The ſecond, of a great
confidence, which he put with all in the goodnes and metcy of God; for the
iuſt man by truſting in God, looſeth not, his feare, and by the feare of
himſelf, caſteth not away his confidence in God. Then if we refer it to the
affection of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, his act is to be declared thus: Lord here I goe forth
only to ſerue thee, and not for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of mine, if I perish, vpon
thy account be it; as if he should ſay; I am ſure that by thy fault I shall
not perish; but I am rather of opinion that this proceeded from a holy feare,
and that which he could haue ſaid, was: Lord here I goe forth not for my owne
intereſt but only to ſerue thee, if I doe ruine my ſelf it will not be by
obeying thee in this vocation which thou giueſt me, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou
haſt determined for mine owne vnworthines, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me, to perish in that
eſtate thou <pb n="19" facs="tcp:5694:14"/>haſt put me in, as Saul did looſe
himſelf in that courſe, wherein thou didſt put him, not by thy fault but
his owne.</p>
               <p>From the very inſtant that Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Lopes made this act, he
found the fauour of God in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very efficacious, and began with great
courage to walke in the narrow path of perfection; in the which he neuer
retired back one foote, or ſtaid, nor euer loſt ſight of that light, with
which God did direct him in this way. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf with continuall
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences. He vſed himſelf to eate but once à day allthough his
meate was but short, and of little nourishement; for the moſt part of his
time it was only Maiz or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian wheate toſted which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians call
Cacalote, and he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this cuſtome ſo ſtrictly euen till his
death, that vpon no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yea though he were grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick, he
would euer breake it. He did neuer eate flesh; yet <pb n="20" facs="tcp:5694:15"/>if any
ſent him ſome ſlices of beefe in almes he receiued them tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
concealing his abſtinence, but he did neuer eate them. Rolles of Indian
wheate were his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bread, and thoſe but ſparingly, and leſſe
then ſufficient ſuſtinance to liue vpon, if God had not ſent him ſuch
fauour as might well ſeeme his, in ſo much that his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </head>
               <p>ALthough the life of Gregory in the wildernes, was ſo
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and ſo retired from the conuerſation of Men, yet there were
ſome that did carp at that <pb n="21" facs="tcp:5694:15"/>eſtranging of himſelf,
eſpecially, becauſe they did not throughly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate that inward
practiſe of his ſoule: and the exteriour, which they ſaw, was different
from that, which is commonly ſeene in ſuch like Men, that are giuen to
ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exerciſes; becauſe they ſaw that vpon many holydaies he did
not goe to Maſſe, and that he had no ſpirituall bookes; thoſe
ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derers of his blameleſſe life, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the way, which
Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory tooke, and wherin God had enlienghted him; was ſo inward, ſo
ſecret, and ſo ſolitary, that euen his ſoule it ſelf, as he often
ſaid, did ſtand in feare, and ſuſpected her owne body. And thus much
touching the ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, for not vseſing bookes of deuotion, and vocall
prayer: as for his hearing of Maſſe vpon daies of obligation, this might
excuſe him, that the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt place to his Cottage or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was 24.
or 30. mile off; yet vpon great daies he alwaies went <pb n="22" facs="tcp:5694:16"/>to
heare it, and afterwardes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to his widernes. But it is no new
thing that the iuſt and freinds of God, ſuffer ſuch like perſecutions,
for as S. Auſtin ſaith very well: perſecution is that which diſpoſeth
the ſeruant of God, for the glorious crowne, which is ready for him in
heauen; and Lactantius ſaith, that an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour or Prince could not know the
valour of his Nobility, if he had not enemies for their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cices and triall.
Beſides this, ſome imputed it to great folly in Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lopes, ſeeing
him chooſe that wildernes before any other, for his aboade in which, thoſe
Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimecos, a rude Nation, did euery day kill and eate ſuch Spaniardes as
they could get in their handes, as if there had not bin thouſands of Angells
garding and watching the nakedneſſe and ſolitarines of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, in
regard of that Lord, whom he ſerued, no man daring to touch him; yea not to
looke on him <pb n="23" facs="tcp:5694:16"/>without reſpect, becauſe, that were to
touch God in the apples of his eies, as he himſelf ſaith, by the Prophet
Zachary, of thoſe who trouble and diſquiet his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants. But
many of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, who paſſed that way, being ignorant of ſuch
deep philoſophy, called him foole and mad Man, and ſaid vnto him: friend
you ſmell of the graue, but the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour of Chriſt did little regard,
theſe feares, for God had infuſed ſuch a loue and reuerence towards him,
in the mindes of that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, that allthough they killed the other
Spaniardes with their accuſtomed cruelty round about him, yet when they came
to the place, where Gregory was, they reuerenced him and ſaluted
himwithſuch courteſyas they were capable of: and not only they but alſo
other India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that were more ciuiliſed, and vnderſtood our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
ſeing him apparelled in that manner, like an hoſpitall <pb n="24" facs="tcp:5694:17"/>brother, and thinking him rather an Eccleſiaſticall perſon then
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by his garments, inſteed of ſaying <hi>Deogratias</hi> vnto him,
they ſaid <hi>Teogratias;</hi> and ſuch was their courteſy a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d kindnes
towards him, as that they offered, him ſome conies a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tunas; a fruit much
eſteemed in thoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues in all things ſo
loueing and ready to aſſiſt him as if he had him their Countriman,
kinſman, or brother; and by this may bee ſeene the loue, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
which they bore him, that ſeing him build that cottà or hermitage, the
Indian Chichime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos themſelues did help him to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it, bringing boughes
and ſtones, and making morter, ſuch is the force of good example and humble
life, as it is able to tame and ſoften the heartes euen of wild beaſts. And
ſo ſaid the Emperour Adrian, as Dion rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that armes and Maieſty
had giuen him the Empire, becauſe, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:5694:17"/>they made him
dreadfull, and that courteouſnes and clemency did maintaine it, becauſe
clemency begetteth loue. But nothing doth ſo much declare and ſet forth the
great force of meeknes, ſweetnes in wordes, lowlines in cariage, cheerfullnes
of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as that manner of extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which Dauid vſeth in the 44.
Pſalme, where ſpeaking euen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally of Chriſt, he ſaith, that, one
thing for which the eternall Father did bleſſe him, was for the comelines
and grace, which was ſpread in his lips.</p>
               <p>But all that which we haue ſaid hitherto, is little in
compariſon of that which now we will ſay. Oh ſweetnes of behauiour! oh
good example in life and manners! how powerfull are you not only on earth, but
euen in heauen? The holy Man Gregory haueing finiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed his little cottage,
thought good to make himſelf a little gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after the manner of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5694:18"/>hermits and Fathers in the deſert, but he went on but
ſlowly in his worke being very weake both by reaſon of continuall
contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, frequent extaſies, as alſo by reaſon of the
auſterities, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications he vſed, ſtanding all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies on his feet
with his head bare both in the ſun and wind; eating only now and then a few
hearbes and morcells of Maiz which the Indians did throw vnto him; being
beſides of a weake conſtitution, as may be ſeen by his phyſiognomy his
picture (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer either for curioſity or deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſireth to ſee
it) is very well drawne in the Imperiall houſe of the Society of Ieſus at
Madrid (which is in Toledo ſtreet) in the Church vpon the ſide altar on the
left hand going vp to the high altar in the picture of S. Ihon Euangeliſt in
the Ile of Pathmos. A certaine Spaniard by name An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Moteno had à
farme neere vnto that place; he came ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <pb n="27" facs="tcp:5694:18"/>to help
the holy Man to worke in his garden, and to make a ditch and a banke, which he
did round about to conuey away the water, and that it might ſerue inſteed
of an hedge or incloſure; and as he came one day amongſt the reſt to
ſee him and help him, from the top of an high hill which did looke into his
garden, he ſaw a thing very ſtrange and worth the relating. Gregory was
digging in his garden, and round about him were many Angells of rare beauty
richly attired and in diuers colours. Some of them did dig o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers caried earth
out of the ditch, and others helped Gregory to lift vp his armes. The man was
aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and ſtood in amazement aboue two howres; he told it to his
wife, who was called Donni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a Maria de Mercado, and, at her intreaty he returned
to ſee the ſame viſion and miracle many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mornings, till he was
aſſured, that it was no dreame nor imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <pb n="28" facs="tcp:5694:19"/>but a

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:5694:19"/>of his combate, that he maruailed how he could hold out and
that his haire did ſtand an end when he remembred thoſe times. This he
ſaid, being now an old beaten ſouldiour and much prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the like

modeſty tell one, that was well affected vnto him, that he had had a combate
and ſpirituall wraſtling with the deuill which was ſo violent, that bloud
burſt out at his eares and noſtrills. The remedie he vſed in theſe
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions was prayer, wherein he continued day and night, and he was faine

once asking him, if it were poſſible to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber himſelf of thoſe

agreeable to the great vigilance and perſeuerance that God had giuen him; in
whatſoeuer he imagined to be the will of God or profitable for his ſoule.
At three yeares end, where in he had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed himſelf in meditating vpon

him from the precept of the Church, it ſeeming vnto them, that only temporall
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was ſufficient to diſpenſe with him, and not the

vnto the deſerts of Nitria in Aegypt, and to many other parts, great numbers
of Men, who did leade a Monaſticall or Heremiticall life <pb n="33" facs="tcp:5694:21"/>not haueing opportunitie in one yeare, no nor in many, to fullfill
that precept, or others ſuch like from the which in the iudgement of all
learned and vertuous men they were lawfully excuſed; and Gregory himſelf
knew that very well, yet neuertheles he yeelded to the frailty and ignorance of
thoſe people, and to auoyd all ſcandall, he went to Alonſo de Aualos his
plantation, where he had commodity of hearing Maſſe, Alonſo de Aualos
receaued him with much loue and courteſy, and offerred him a houſe and
garden of a very good aire, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he did not eate flesh
commanded his ſteward to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy an Indian to catch fish for him, Gregory
accepted of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but would not conſent by any meanes, that any Man
should be ſet on worke for him and ſo for the ſpace of two yeares which
he ſpent in that place he liued onely vpon milke, and curdes, this time 
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5694:22"/>expired (vnderſtanding that it was the will of God) he
determined to returne to Zacatecas, and the night before his departure, as he
was expecting day light to take his iourney, the terrible earthquake began,
which was in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the yeare 1576. and as Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory was going to open
his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the beames of his chamber fell without doing him any harme. In
this iourney he came to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Sebaſtian Mexia, who gaue him good
entertainment, which he required with his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous example and good aduiſe,
the which made ſuch impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his hoſt that preſently laying
aſide his rich apparell he cloathed himſelf in ſack cloth like Gregory
Lopes, to whom he bore ſuch an affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and reſpect, that he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to put both ſoule and goods in his hand to manage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them
according to the great prudence, which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that God beſtowed
vpon <pb n="35" facs="tcp:5694:22"/>him. But he ſuſpecting it, and knowing that
Sebaſtian Mexia was shortly to dy, thought it was not for his purpoſe, to
take vpon him the charge of other mens goods, who to ſerue god more freely,
had diſcharged himſelf of his owne: and to the great griefe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, he

them do that which belonged to their office. Gregory did that with ſuch care

filled all with the admiration of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, loue of his good carriage and
deſire of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany; but he haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got enough in two months ſpace to
put himſelf in cloaths, tooke his leaue of them leauing them ſory for his
departure, which they could not remedy neither with intreaties, nor teares, nor
mony which they offerred him.</p>
               <p>Whilſt Gregory Lopes walked in the wildernes, great were the
terrours, with which the deuill endeauoured to affright him, make him turne
backe and leaue off his holy purpoſe; ſometimes with the roarings and the
howlings of the wild beaſts, other times with the cruell deaths, that the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Chichimecos put the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards vnto euery day in that place, othertimes
he aſſailed him <pb n="38" facs="tcp:5694:24"/>with diuerſe in ward temptations, and
therfore the more crafty, and deeeitfull, but he had preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to
his prayres and ſuch weapons as God had giuen him for his defence, which was
a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reſignation wherwith he put himſelf, and his affaires in the
hands of God. He did repeato thoſe wordes, wherin he had fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch light
and erudition, <hi>fiat vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntastua, &amp;c.</hi> and preſtrate on the
ground in the ſight of God he ſaid: oh Lord thou art a Father and all
things are done in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and with thy will. With this he got new
ſtrength to goe on in his way.</p>
               <p>He liued in great pouerty, as is ſaid, yet he neuer as ked
almes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this time, nor euer after in his life, but truſting wholly
to the diuine Prouidence, he did eate that which Men gaue him of their owne
accord without asking, and when that failed, he did earne it with his labour.
He paſſed many <pb n="39" facs="tcp:5694:24"/>daies, only with Indian wheate toſted,
and ſome lents only with purslane, whereby he came to haue a great weaknes in
his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, which gaue him occaſion to merit all his life time. Somtimes
he vſed to exerciſe his body in his little garden, and he did ſeldome or
neuer eate of the hearbes, which he planted and cultiuated, but very charitably
gaue them to thoſe that paſſed that way. He did ſpend euery day ſome
time in the holy Scripture, and ſome times his lecture was in the Epiſtles
of S. Paul in Spanish, before they were forbidden, of which we shall ſpeake
more at large in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place.</p>

               <p>GRegory Lopes would haue ſpent the reſt of his life in that

many daies all alone, with the diſcommodities that may be imagined, in great
want of all things neceſſary for his cure, and euen for his ordinary
ſuſtenance, till it pleaſed God, that a prieſt of a very exemplar life,
by name I hon de Meſa who inſtructed thoſe people wihout any ſtipend,
ſpending his meanes freely among the poore and needy, ſending pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
for the ſick man cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his owne houſe with all diligence and

much weakned, by reaſon that he had not eaten anything in many daies before,
he fell a ſleep, but wakned againe vntimely, with a little ſtrength and
ſtomack to his meate, and in a short time he perfectly recouered. Neuertheles
his good hoſt would not ſuffer him to returne to the wildernes 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5694:27"/>againe, but keept him in his houſe almoſt foure yeares
with great edification both to himſelf and his neighbours round about, who
moued with the report of his good carriage, came to ſee him, although he
neuer reuealed to any what he was, what his vocation, nor the mentall
exerciſes which he vſed, only his outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour was that, which made
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both admire and loue him; yet there wanted not ſome, that did behold
him with a quite different eie, and ſo framed different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of his
manner of life; for hauing no office nor exerciſe, as they thought, to employ
himſelf in, they deemed him to be an idle fellow, and one of no worth; yea
their ſuſpicion paſſed farther, for ſome thought him an heretick,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſaw him come to heare Maſſe, and comply with the other
outward obligations of a Chriſtian, as well as the reſt.</p>
               <p>And becauſe vpon this occaſion, <pb n="45" facs="tcp:5694:27"/>I got
the firſt knowledge of his manner of life, I will here ſet downe the
relation, which they gaue me of him. About that time, there came a prieſt
from thoſe parts, to the city of Mexico, and amongſt other
buſineſſes, which he came to treate of, one was that their liued in that
place, a man, who he feared very much, was a Lutherane heretick, becauſe he
did not cary any beades about him, nor shewed any other ſuch ſignes, with
which good Chriſtias shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deuotion, and vprightnes of heart. I asked
him, whether he ſpoke well in things touching our faith; he anſwered, that
he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be well grounded in the Catholick doctrine, that he knew all
the bible by heart, that in his behauiour he was blameles, and that he was
allmoſt allwaies alone, as if he had great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes though he did
not impart them to any. He ſtaies à great while in the Church, and we
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <pb n="46" facs="tcp:5694:28"/>not get out of him, of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he is, who
were his parents, or kinsfolke, and liueing in the world he doth not meddle
with any thing of this world, as if he did not liue in it. I replyed
familiarly, that I would not haue that prieſt be like vnto Hely, who thought,
that the changes which Anna made in her countenance, at ſuch time as she
praied earneſtly in the preſencee of God, were cauſed by drunkennes, if
you should ſee a theefe without his beades, you would not therefore account
him an heretick; how much leſſe a man of ſo good a life, ſo
conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the holy Scripture; and whoſe eonuerſation ſeemeth only
ton be with God. The prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiced with this reaſon, anſwered, that he
liked well of that which I told him, and that it was likely, that he was
à very good man, and ſaid moreouer: I will cary him a hat for he
weareth none (perhapes becauſe he hath none) and I will <pb n="47" facs="tcp:5694:28"/>not informe the Inquiſition of him as I thought to haue done. This
paſſed betwixt the prieſt and me concerning Gregory Lopes, whom I knew
not of till then; neither did I then know his name allthough by the ſaid
relation, I conceiued a good opinion of his manner of life, God beginning then,
though I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to shew his great fauours and mercies, which he was to
doe me by meanes of this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, as shall be ſaid hereafter.</p>

               <p>THe deſire which Gregory Lopes had to liue vnknowne, and the

hauing bin, about foure yeares in Guaſteca, ſeing himſelf knowne and much
eſteemed both by Spaniards and Indians; by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt
(for it is to be thought that he neuer chaged his habitation without it) he
departed towards Atriſco, and being within a league of the towne, God brought
him vnto a man of good eſteeme, by name Ihon Perez Romero who gaue him
lodging and all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his maintenauce in his mannour.
Gregory was there well treated, becauſe his hoſts were good Chriſtians,
and benefited themſelues with the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failes and examples which he gaue
them (for that was the gratifying and recompence, which Gregory 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5694:29"/>left to them, that entertained him, and whereſoeuer he
came) the temper of the country was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable vnto him, and the riuers,
brookes and pleaſantnes of the fieldes did further him much in his deuotion
and recollection. But it was not the will of God, that he should ſtay in that
place aboue two yeares, becauſe the ſower of coccle, the enemy of our good
is wont to hide the vertue, and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the light, which shineth and

Teſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, lifting vp his eies, he eſpied the houſe and ſanctuary of our
Lady of Remedies on the other ſide of the city; and thinking that there might
be there, ſome habitation, wherein he might continue his ſolitary life, he
trauailed ſtraight towards that place, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Mexico, and
ſeeing that it was a place dedicated to the Mother of God, he reioyced
exceedingly, and purpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in that place in ſeruice of the

was, and there were ſcarce any that made any eſteeme of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he
was very wary in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="52" facs="tcp:5694:31"/>any outward shew of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
which God did vnto him, but ſeemed outwardly a ſimple Man, of few wordes
and of a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vnderſtanding; none did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort vnto him, none did light
vpon that treaſure, which God had in ſecret in that wildernes. By reaſon
of this he was in great neceſſity, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d want of ſuſtenance, in ſo much
that I haue knowne him paſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies, only with wild quinces; but, time
running on, men began to take more notice of him, ſome deuout perſons, who
did there keepe their nouendialls inuiting him now and then to dinner, and they
did behold with care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, their gueſts new attire, and manner of
life; ſome were edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his conuerſation, others did beware of him,
holding it a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious matter to ſtray from the common courſe, others
leſſe adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, iudged him to be a Man of ill life and a diſſembling
heretick, and therefore did abhorre and fly <pb n="53" facs="tcp:5694:31"/>his company,
and he in that kind ſuffered much with wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, allthough I
could not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto learne any notable thing, that hapned vnto him in that

good memory who like a vigilant and carefull Prelate, thought good to informe
himſelf of the life and behauiour of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Lopes, and the ſpirit, by
which he was directed. I went about that time to our Lady of Remedies to ſee
him, and by the conferences which I had with him, I remained well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
touching his ſpirit, and iudged him, to be a man of ſolid and well grounded
vertue. I gaue this relation to the ſaid Archbiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, and told him that was
my opinion; he for his more ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and better performance of his

Father Alonſo San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:5694:32"/>of the ſociety of Ieſus, a

making (as they vſe to ſay) an anatomy of him, and to acquaint himſelf
with his emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, exerciſes, and manner of proceeding. The ſaid Father
went with this commiſſion to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Remedies where he ſpent much

               </head>
               <p>GRegory Lopes had liued two yeares in the houſe of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Remedies when he found himſelf very weake, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a paine in
the ſtomach, and the collick; and by reaſon of theſe indiſpoſitions,
thoſe cold, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bluſtering winds, which doe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily blow in thoſe
high Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, were very hurtfull to him, and therefore it was neceſſary
in regard of his health, to goe to the Hoſpitall of Guaſteca which is
ſeated in the Marqueſate of Valle 36. miles of Mexico. As ſoone as the
Archbishop vnderſtood his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, he ſent him an horſe of his owne
ſtable, and ſome dainties <pb n="58" facs="tcp:5694:34"/>by a ſeruant who was to

ſeruant and I departed from our Lady of Remedies, in the yeare 1580. towards
Guaſteca, and ſo great was the eſteeme of thoſe, who had conuerſed
with him in that place, that at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, all made meanes to get ſome
part of his poore houshold-ſtuffe, which was at that time two or three
sheepskins, which ſerued inſteed of a bed, and a little pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to keep
water in. And all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I endeauoured allſo to get one of thoſe
sheepskins, I could neuer obtaine it, though I was Curate of the Cathedrall,
and ſo well knowne by all: ſuch was the affection, and deuotion, with which
the good people did aske them. I left Gregory in his way to Guaſteca, leaſt
I should be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my office in Mexico. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory therefore in the company
of the Archbishops ſeruant, arriued at <pb n="59" facs="tcp:5694:34"/>Guaſteca, where
he was recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by brother Stephen de Herre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, allthough the commodity was
but ſmall, by reaſon of the great pouerty which the hoſpitall did
ſuffer in its beginning. He lodged him in his owne chamber, hauing order to
giue him that which was neceſſary for his ſuſtenance, and not to employ
him in any thing. The brother vſed him with all loue and kindnes, as he did
vſe to doe all, that repaired thither; who though they were many in number,
by reaſon of the pleaſant temperature and wholſomenes of that aire, and
the Hoſpitall poore at that time; hauing neither rents to maintenance the
poore, nor houſeroome to lodge them, nor any thing wherewith to build, yet it
neuer was wanting to their cure and reliefe: a thing truly, which if we did
conſider it only humanly, would ſeeme impoſſible and far from the
truth: but ſuch was the courage of Bernardin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uares <pb n="60" facs="tcp:5694:35"/>the
founder, not only of that Hoſpitall, but allſo of that of the
Conualeſcents in Mexico, and of many others which are ſpread ouer all new
Spaine, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued his moſt proſperours ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, for the
reliefe, and help of many. I remember that when I asked of this great ſeruant
of God, his good will, that Gregory Lopes might be receiued in that
Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, he anſwered me: would to God, Father Loſa, that I could bring
all the poore Men in the world to my hoſpitall, I truſt in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them all: be it with all my hart as you
deſire: and well may it bee ſeene, that this hoſpitall was gouerned by
Gods prouidence, for within two yeares after it was founded, there was in that
houſe of Guaſteca, allowance for 72. perſons, and from that time forward
it hath increaſed ſo much, that now, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a table in that
deſert for all <pb n="61" facs="tcp:5694:35"/>ſorts of poore and needy people both men
and weomen, ſpaniar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and Indians, that come to the hoſpitall to be
healed not only out of new Spaine, but allſo from Guatimala, and Peru, for
the good entertainment which they find there, and abundance of all things
neceſſary for their health and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and the great care and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with which they are looked vnto, ſo as allmoſt all that goe thither, with
allmoſt incurable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, in a little time recouer their perfect
health; and thus much in briefe of this famous hoſpitall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thimke
that Gregory Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes his being there at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, was no ſmale
cauſe of of its increaſe. In this place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gregory had his
maintenance ſure, vnder the title of voluntary pouerty, and laying aſide
care of all things (allthough the care of temporall things did neuer moleſt
him) he gaue himſelf wholly to contemplation and mentall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5694:36"/>practiſing himſelf in the loue of God and his
Neighbour, in which he had laboured many yeares. But all though the exerciſe
was allwaies the ſame, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes euery day were new, he was all
the day retired in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by himſelf, he went out onely to heare
Maſſe vpon Sundaies, and holidaies, and ſome of the weeke daies, and then
alſo only to the hoſpitall chappell, and if at any time he failed there, he
went to the Monaſtery of S. Dominick to heare it there; and though that place
was very pleaſant by reaſon of the many good ſprings, fields, and groues
of trees, and proſpects, yet he ſeldome or neuer went out to ſee them,
for being of a weake and tender conſtitution, the ill ſmell of the
contagious diſeaſes, which are there cured, did much annoy him: for this
cauſe ſome of thoſe that aſſiſted in the hoſpitall did murmur
againſt him (for it is no new thing for Martha to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5694:36"/>of Mary) as an vnprofitable impertinent and idle Man. But
thoſe that did attentiuely conſider the actions of Gregory, did eſteeme
of him otherwiſe; for they found in themſelues the fauour and aide, which
God gaue them by meanes of his prayres, and that by them was increaſed their
bodily ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to aſſiſte the ſick both day and night They allſo
perceiued the gift of counſailing which God had giuen him, wherewith he did
comfort thoſe, that repaired vnto him in their afflictions and paines. He had
an eſpeciall faculty in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying many of the diſeaſed, who either
through their ill conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>es of their diſeaſes, were ſo teſty and froward, that the
infirmarians could not brooke them, ſo that theſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he
was no ſmall help to the hoſpitall, eſpecially being a man, that had no
office or obligation to meddle with any of theſe things, for he was neuer one
of thoſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <pb n="64" facs="tcp:5694:37"/>that looke to the Conualeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
and Bernardin Aluares had as is ſaid before, giuen expreſſe command, that
he should not be employed in any thing. I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued (not without profit
of my ſoule) that the diuell our enemie, hauing got the worſt, and being
ouercome before in any kind of combate returneth to the fight afresh, in ſuch
manner lifteth vp his head, and with that fiercenes aſſaileth againe, as if
he had gon away before with the victory: ſo he did againe encounter this man,
as if he had had only to deale with our weaknes, and as if there were not with
vs, and within vs, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Almighty God, and the aide of Chriſt the
ſtrong armed, as often as we aske it with faith, and hope. Gregory knowing
well this defence as an old ſouldiour vnder our captaine Ieſus Chriſt;
when I did tell him of any of my combates either interiour, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, he
anſwered with the holy <pb n="65" facs="tcp:5694:37"/>Ghoſt: he that is not tempted,
what doth he knowe, as if he should ſay, he knoweth nothing. In thoſe daies
that admirable Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Father Peter de Prauia, a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, a mirrour and
patterne of wiſedome humility and religion (who had renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced a Bishoprick,
being then firſt reader of diuinity, and Vicar Generall of the
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick of Mexico (his ſoule I hope is endued with much glory in
heauen, with his holy Father S. Dominick) went very ſecretly to to
Guaſteca, to be aſſured of the life and conuerſation of Gregory Lopes;
and it is likely that ſuch a perſonage, ſo free from paſſion, was
moued with ſufficient cauſe, to goe for that purpoſe in perſon: in fine
he made particular enquiry of his manner of life, and was ſo well ſatisfied
of him, that from that time forward, he bore him more loue, and reſpect, and
I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this, allthough the ſaid father, allbeit he imparted to me other 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5694:38"/>things of more importance and ſecrecy, yet he neuer made
me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his intention in going thither.</p>
               <p>I haue allſo vnderſtood, that the Bishop of Guadalaiara with
all care and diligence, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of the life of Gregory in thoſe
ſeauen yeares, which, as we ſaid, he liued in his Dioceſe, and when Satan
had vſed all his power to darken the life and fame of this great ſeruant of
God, he allwaies came forth more pure and bright, like gold out of the
furnace.</p>
               <p>Gregory did another worke of great profit in that hoſpitall,
for he writ a booke of Phyſick, partly out of Sundry experiences, and partly
by the great knowledge of the properties, and naturall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the hearbes,
wher with he was endued. The hoſpitall bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made great vſe of this
booke, both for the curing of their ſick, and when they went about all the
country toaske almes. And <pb n="67" facs="tcp:5694:38"/>ſuch was the good
ſucceſſe of thoſe remedies and medicines, which they did apply to
ſundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes by the preſcription of that booke, as if the authour
therof had ſpent many yeares in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of phyſick. He ſpent ſome
time in making and mending his poore clothes, for he had a particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
euen in that, and he did both cut-out and make vp all his owne clothes (euen to
his gray gaber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine with which he couered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) excepting a hatt, which
he neuer vſed, vnleſſe he trauailed much in the Sun. He did not make
himſelf any new shooes, but he mended them ſo well, as that one paire would
laſt three yeares.</p>

eaſily be perceiued, that God had brought him for that purpoſe to this

here (but only to heare Maſſe in the Colledge of the Society of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus)
euen not to ſee the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of Villamanrique the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roies wife,
who had a great deſire to ſee him and had requeſted me thrice to bring
him to the Pallace, but he excuſed himſelf to me ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had no
need of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Marqueſſe, nor she of him. and in this act he shewed no
ſmall cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, eſpecially the Marquis being at that time in great
eſteeme and his lady obeyed and reſpected by all Neuertheles ſome yeares
after, Gregory vnderſtanding, that the Marquis was much troubled with a

viſite the Lady Marqueſſe if she <pb n="71" facs="tcp:5694:40"/>would ſend for me,
and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis were at that time in Teſcuco, and Gregory in Santafe; where

he could eaſily haue made, and in time of aduerſity he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf
to doe it, being then aboue 4. miles going and comming.</p>
               <p>He was not as yet perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in Mexico, and his
lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering ague did not forfake him, he was very weake and had but little
ſtomack to his meate; on the other ſide he longed for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
ſolitarines, and allthough he had ſtrictly obſerued it within my houſe
at Mexico, yet he made more account of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try; and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went about carefully, to ſeeke out ſome ſeate neere the

much to Gods ſeruice; for I had bin aboue twenty yeares Curate of the great
Church, and had the charge of ſuch poore people as were ashamed to beg, whom
I did prouide of ſuch things as were neceſſary, with the almes which I
did continually aske for that purpoſe, for ten yeares and more; for which
reaſon my Superiours doubted very much, whether it was conuenient to giue me
leaue or no to retire my ſelf to a ſolitary life. At length it pleaſed
God ſo to diſpoſe this matter, as that I reſolued that this courſe
was couenient, and my ſuperiours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended vnto it, and gaue me
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which till then was denied <pb n="76" facs="tcp:5694:43"/>me; ſo I came to

only vpon diuers occaſions, when it ſeemed neceſſary for my profit, or
the good of other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nout perſons; and all this hape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo ſeldome and
ſo vnawares, that I did not take ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t notice of it, to cary it away;
neither did I <pb n="77" facs="tcp:5694:43"/>thinke I should out-liue him ſo much, as to
be able to write of him, and this which is writen of him is very little in
reſpect of that which is wanting. Thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thinges, which I marked
in him, would be very hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated hiſtorically, only I will note,
that his life was vniforme, ſo as that which he did one day, he did another,
and with this rule he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed months and yeares. Therefore I will briefly
ſet downe how he ſpent the day and night, that hereby we may gather ſome
little part of the great vertue, which was in him.</p>
               <p>At breake of day he did open his chamber window that he might
begin to diſpoſe and order his daies worke; and washing his face and hands,
as ſoone as it was day light he read in the bible à little more then a
quarter of an hower, and then shut his booke againe. His end in reading that
booke, was only becauſe it was <pb n="78" facs="tcp:5694:44"/>the holy Scripture, and
becauſe God had giuen it him to reade; and allſo, that if he did not
vnderſtand ſome thing the firſt time, he might vnderſtand it the
ſecond: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he did beare ſuch a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and
reuerence to the holy writ, that vpon the reading of it, he grounded that which
he had to doe in the day time, and that ſo conſtantly and duely, as that
ſome few daies before his death he ſaid; I haue not read in the bible
theſe ten daies, I doe nor remember that I haue omitted it ſo long a time
before, ſince I began to liue ſolitary. After he had read the Scripture; he
betooke himſelf to his other exerciſe, which was ſo inward and ſecret,
as that by no outward ſignes, it could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of what kind it was,
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer, meditation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, if it was of ſad thinges, or
ioyfull, whether he was in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or paſſion, whether he ſpoke with God,
or God with him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="79" facs="tcp:5694:44"/>it might be gathered by his great
modeſty and grauity of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that he was continually in the preſence
of God, neuer looſing ſight of him; allthough he neuer imparted theſe
thinges to others, yet he told me thoſe thinges, which I haue writ of him,
and shall write hereafter. He did allſo vpon an occaſion which I will here
relate, declare ſome thing to Don Fray Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de Salazar then Bishop of the
Philippines, who returning from thence to Mexico, to goe to Spaine, paſſed
by Santafe on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to viſit Gregory Lopes, with whom he had had great
familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as is ſaid before in the fourth Chapter. This prelate, among
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges deſired him to tell him, what exerciſe he vſed and wherin
God, had employed him? to which he anſwered plainly that his exerciſe was
to loue God and his neighbour. The Bishop replied: you told me these ſame 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5694:45"/>words in Amayca fiue and twenty yeares a goe, how is this?
haue you bin allwaies doing the ſame? Gregory anſwered: I haue allwaies
done this, though there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt that times worke and this.
Wherby it is euident, that the preſence of God, which Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory practiſed,
was not meerely that only, but was accompanied with à feruent loue of
God and his neighbour which is the end of all the diuine precepts, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the
higheſt degree of perfection, that can be attained in this life. This he gaue
himſelf to both morning and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the moſt part of the night.
Theſe were his prayers, theſe his meditations, this was the daily bread,
wheron that religious ſoule did feed. And though he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this
all the day, yet I did marke, that in the morning chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly, he was with this
exerciſe, as it were, tranſported. He had no certaine place nor poſture
of body which he did ordinarily vſe in it; <pb n="81" facs="tcp:5694:45"/>moſt
commonly he did ſtand, or ſitt, or walke in his Chamber; ſometimes he
went out into a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, which was neare his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to enioy the ſun a
while. In his latter yeares he could not kneele, by reaſon of his weaknes of
body. At eleauen we did dine both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with another gueſt if there were
any, for Gregory did not eſtrange himſelf from any, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not from
deuout or religious perſons. In dinner time our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was of God, or
of ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thinges, out of which he did draw ſome Spirituall
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, grounding very profund doctrine vpon them. After dinner he
ſpent ſometime in theſe kinds of diſcourſes. When there was any
religious perſon preſent, that made vp the third, he did harken very
attentiuely vnto him, but would neuer begin any diſcourſe himſelf,
vnleſſe he were asked, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion did ſo require. At
other times, I did reade vnto him <pb n="82" facs="tcp:5694:46"/>ſome ſaincts liues
out of Villegas his Flos Sanctorum; S. Francis his Chronicles, the booke,
called the ſpirituall meadow, and other ſuch bookes, and this exerciſe
laſted two yeares and more. His time of recreation being ended, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
vnto his chamber, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in his vnion with God. which he did neuer
interrupt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with eating, or talking, or any other outward occupation:
he did neuer ſleep in the day time, ſo that he had the more time to
conuerſe with God. If towardes euening (for it ſeldome hapned in the
mornings) there came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him, any body that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to talke with
him in priuate about buſines, he denied entrance to none, he gaue counſaile
and comfort to all, and offered to all his aſſiſtance in his prayers vnto
God without exception of perſons or times, ſo that in theſe laſt yeares
he was much viſited, not only by <pb n="83" facs="tcp:5694:46"/>the common ſort, but
much more by religious Men and Cleargy men, and men of great learning and
authority. There were many gentlemen and great Ladies that had recourſe vnto
him, ſometimes in perſon, othertimes by letters, making him acquainted with
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and deſiring his counſaile, and prayers alſo for their good
ſucceſſe. But amongſt others, Don Luys de Velaſco, Marquis of
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linas (who was Preſident of the Councell, and had bin twice Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of
new Spaine, and once of Peru) came ſome times to viſit Gregory Lopes, for
the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and reſpect which he did beare vnto him, and ſtaied
with him ſometimes two or three howres together; and he found in him
ſufficient vnderſtanding to treate, not only of his priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
belonging to his ſoule, but allſo of the publick belonging to the
gouernement of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:5694:47"/>In this manner Gregory ſpent the euenings,
before ſunſet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himſelf to his chamber, and did not come fourth
againe till the morning. He neuer vſed cadle light, from the time that he
went into the wildernes, which made ſome aske me out of curioſity, what he
did all the night in the darke, not conſidering, that his exerciſe, being
interiour, did not depend of this materiall light, but of the ſpirituall,
which neither day nor night was wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting. He did neuer eate ſupper as is
ſaid, and ſo was all alone in the darke, vntill mine and a halfe, or ten,
and then he laied himſelf downe vpon his little couch, couered only with a
meane couerlet; and this was the ſofteſt bed, that euer he had, for at
firſt the bare grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was his bed, afterwardes ſome sheepskins, and ſome
few yeares before his death he accepted at my earneſt in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a little
thin mattreſſe, and the couerlet I ſpoke of. In this manner 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5694:47"/>he did ſleep, to my thinking, not aboue two or three
howers in all the night; for he did ſpend the reſt awake in contemplation
till day light, when, as is ſaid, he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his window. He vſed all the
daies of his life, the ſelf ſame exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes as is ſaid, and in this
manner he paſſed ouer the time that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Santafe, vntil it
pleaſed God to take him away to enioy euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt.</p>

hath prepared for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, for in the Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of May 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5694:48"/>1596. he was ſtricken with an aire, which did ſo
diſtemper him, as that he neuer found himſelf ſo weake and ill
diſpoſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he loſt his ſtomack alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſo
much as that he could not swallow downe any thing but liquid thinges, and them
allſo with much difficulty. Few daies after he fell into the flux (a
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe troubleſome, nnd dangerous in ſuch a weake body) yet he would
not ſuffer, that a Phyſitian should be ſent for, partly, becauſe of the
experience which he had in the cure of that diſeaſe, and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knew, that the ſtrong medicines, which the Phyſitians vſe to apply,
would in leſſe time waſt the little ſtrength, which he found in
himſelf, and ſeeing me ſolicitous by reaſon of his diſeaſe, and
that I deſired much, that ſome remedies should be applied, he ſaid vnto
me: now, Father Loſa, let vs walke Gods pace, as if he should ſay, that
conformity and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="87" facs="tcp:5694:48"/>of mind was for thoſe
times, and not to be talked of, when there is nothing that troubleth vs, but
all goeth well with vs: ſo he was vſed to ſay commonly, that
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation is alltogether deedes, and hath no wordes. He ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſome
daies after this manner, with that patience and courage as he was vſed to
ſuffer his other ſickneſſes. vntill vpon the day of S. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
the 24. of Iune, I thought it fitting to giue him the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and askeing him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought it good to receiue it then, he anſwered
yes, and that he reioyced much, that it was vpon the day of S. Iohn Baptiſt
his eſpeciall patron. I gaue him the bleſſed Sacrament, and fearing that
his death did draw neere I had ſome holy oile in readines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it was
needfull: for beſides his great weaknes and illſtomach, he had got a hicket
that was very painefull vnto him, and his pulſe did beate with
intermiſſions: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <pb n="88" facs="tcp:5694:49"/>all this, ſuch was
his courage, that the very ſame day that he receiued his Viaticum, and all
the daies following he riſe out of his bed, and made it himſelf; he made
himſelf readie, and allwaies, euen to his death, he did riſe to the
ſtoole, and though commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was offered him, yet he would mortify himſelf
in not vſing it. He grew weaker euery day, not being able to eate any thing
at all, he only ſuſtained himſelf with ſtrong waters, which were ſent
him in great quantity from Mexico, by perſons of quality; which when he
receiued, admiring at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, he ſaid, with great feeling:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hou art wonderfull, o Lord, for
that a Man who in all the world doth not poſſeſſe a pin of his owne,
should haue need to liue vpon waters of kings and princes, and should find
thoſe, that would giue him them without ſeeking for. Now the day of the
glorious Apoſtles S. Peeter and Paul <pb n="89" facs="tcp:5694:49"/>was come, and I
doubting that my ſick man would not out-liue that day, thought it moſt
ſecure to giue him Extreme Vnction. He was very glad that this Sacrament was
to be adminiſtred vnto him vpon that day of the Princes of the Church to whom
he was much deuored, and had allwaies a deſire to ſerue. The time being
come, wherin I was to giue him abſolution in vertue of his Bulla Cruzada, I
bad him call to mind ſome ſin, though of the yeares paſt, that I might
abſolue him, and apply vnto him the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of the See Apoſtolick;
whereunto, he anſwered, that by the mercy of God he did not feele any thing
trouble his conſcience; the which was to be vnderſtood of mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5694:50"/>he ſaid that he did not remember any veniall ſin, not
becauſe he had neuer committed any, but becauſe he had not committed them
wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, and being asked ſodainly, it might very well be, that he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred none. With that I gaue him the Sacrament of Extreme Vnction;
afterwardes importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, that he would ſuffer sheetes to be brought him,
to eaſe him ſomewhat of his paines, he anſwered: now that I am anoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led I
may receiue them, and, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that his death drew neare, I ſaid vnto him:
will you dy now? then ſpeaking to himſelf, he ſaid: now nature wilt thou
dy? shewing by this, the pity and compaſſion, which the ſpirit had of the
body, or the higher part of his ſoule of the lower ond ſenſitiue: for
Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory vnderſtood very well, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion and anatomy of the inward Man
and the outward, and the parts of both, and he was vſed to diſcourſe very
elegantly of it. So <pb n="91" facs="tcp:5694:50"/>vehement were the paines, which he
endured in his body, as that I once asking him, how he did, and where was his
paine? he ſaid, that from the ſole of his feet to the crowne of his head
there was no part free from paine; ad beſides this, our Lord on the other
ſide did afflict him in the moſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and ſenſible part of his
ſoule, ſo that both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he might haue abundant
occaſion of merit. In this kind I will tell one thing that was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
knowne in Mexico, though perhaps all doe not relate it ſo preciſely as it
hapned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not amiſſe to ſet downe the truth. I will
conceale the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons names becauſe thoſe that knowe them will eaſily
gueſſe the right, and thoſe that doe not knowe them, there is no reaſon
why they should.</p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that came from Mexico to
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Gregory in this his laſt ſicknes, <pb n="92" facs="tcp:5694:51"/>there was a
great Lady, who was wife to a noble man, that ſerued the king in an
honourable office. She did not giue ſuch Good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in the city as she
might haue done, both in matter of brauery and exceſſiue expences, as
alſo in playing at crades, wherin she loſt much time and mony allſo,
drawing after her ſome other noble weomen, who, vnder her wing, did dare to
giue ſcope to that vice, their husbands not being able to hinder them. This
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy came to Santafe the third of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeauenteen daies before Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
death, to viſit him, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish him, for allthough in the thinges
aforeſaid she was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what faulty, yet for workes of merey, and
compaſſion towardes the poore and afflicted, she was much to be commended.
As ſoone as I vnderſtood of her comming, I ſent word vnto her, that she
should not come into the houſe; hauing made ſuch little vſe of his 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5694:51"/>prayers and labours for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bin here before, she
had not left off playing art cardes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the ſcandall which she
did giue therby, being a purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſo noble a gentleman as her husband
was; therefore she might returne to Mexico, for there was no meanes to ſee
the ſick man, neither would her almes be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnto him. She made
diuerſe replies, and in meſſages back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes and forwardes, were ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
three or foure howers, I ſtill deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her leaue to come and viſit him.
Whileſt therfore this Lady expected the laſt reſolution and anſwer,
that deuote of ours, whom I ſpoke of, and others allſo certified me, that
she came with a great deſire to amend, and leaue of her idle life, and
gaming, and that therfore it would much auaile for her entire amendment, to
comfort her, and yeeld to that which she did ſo much deſire, wherwith I was
ſatisfied, and of <pb n="94" facs="tcp:5694:52"/>opinion that she should ſee him. As
she came in at the doore, a far of he ſaid vnto her: Father Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa had
promiſed, that you should not come in at this doore; to which she anſwered:
he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but I will amend. As ſoone as she ſaw Gregory she tooke
much compaſſion of his infirmity, and began preſently to ſerue him with
her owne handes ſitting on her knees at his bedd ſide, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to dreſſe
his meate, for in that she had a ſpeciall faculty, though she had a greater
in commending herſelf earneſtly to his prayers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vſe of that
good occaſion in time before it ſlipt away; for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt she was here,
she was euery day both morning and euening with the ſickman a great while,
beſeeching him vpon her knees, and with teares, in her eies, that he would
pray for her, and take her ſoule into his charge. Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she began to
feele a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in her mind; for now she <pb n="95" facs="tcp:5694:52"/>did take
content in treating of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matters, and of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding her life; and there
in my preſence she did burne a paire of cardes, which she had brought with
her in her ſleeue, to paſſe the time withall a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d came to me to
confeſſion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time I perceiued a change in her ſoule. In
fine ſome few daies before she was to returne to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xico, hauing bin one
morning, as she was wont to doe, intreating the ſick man to aſſiſt her
with his prayers to our Lord, she turned to me very ioyfull, and ſaid: Father
Loſa beare me witnes, that Father Gregory Lopes hath promiſed me, that when
I dye, he will come for my ſoule to cary it to heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I doe not
knowe the way And to Gregory Lopes she asked him: doe you make me this
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? to which he anſwered: yes, I promiſſe you. After this
diſcourſe enſued two things very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable; one was, that the paines
and torments of Gregory did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <pb n="96" facs="tcp:5694:53"/>very much, the
other was, that this Lady fell into the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, whereof Gregory
died: yet notwithſtanding, she ſtaied two daies in this village ſerueing
him as much as her ſicknes would giue her leaue, and powring out, being vpon
her knees before him, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant teares of repentance. With this aſſurance
she returned to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xico, becauſe her ſicknes increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and at her
taking leaue Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory ſaid vnto her: fare well, for we shall not ſee one
another againe by reaſon of our weaknes of body. As ſoone as she came to
her houſe, she did write vnto me ſome good ſayings wherby she did shew,
that her ſoule was toucht by the powerfull hand of God, and among other
things she ſaid vnto me, that the Phyſitians of her body did apply to her
diſeaſe many good medicines, but that she did moſt deſire, that the
Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians of her ſoule would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber her often in their prayers to 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5694:53"/>God. Her infirmity waxed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with
confuſion and ſorrow for her ſinnes, and ſignes of true repentance. At
the ſame time I did alſo perceiue that Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory his paines were
increaſed; for that Lady being allmoſt at the point of death, there came
hither Martin Lopes de Guana a publik Notary, to viſit our ſick man, as he
did vſe to doe at other times, with a meſſage from the ſaid La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who
deſired him to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her, and he requeſted the ſame in the name
of all his houſe and his owne; whereunto Gregory replied, as one that had a
great weight vpon him: ſo I doe, I feele her ly very heauy vpon me. This
ſeemed ſtrange vnto me, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perceiued any thing in him that did
moleſt him, or that he complained of but only in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion To conclude
the Lady died, leauing behind her great tokens of her ſaluation, and shewing,
at the hower of her death, ſuch <pb n="98" facs="tcp:5694:54"/>ſignes of true
repentance, and ſorrow for the ill example, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she had withdrawne
other perſons after her, as that this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine alteration was of no
leſſe edification, then the diſorders and looſenes of her life paſt,
had bin of ſcandall; and within few how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the newes of her death co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to
vs, I told it vnto Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he with a joyfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſaid only
theſe wordes: God is powerfull. I asked of a brother of the Conualeſcents
who neuer went out of Gregory his ſight, whether at that time and hower when
the Lady died as they told vs, he had perceiued any vnuſuall thing; and he
told me, yes, for he ſaw him beſides himſelf and, as it were in an
extaſie at the ſame time; wherby I did gather, that it had pleaſed God,
to accomplish Gregory his promiſſe, and that he had bin preſent in
ſpirit at the death of his deuote, and carried her to Purgatory that
afterwarde <pb n="99" facs="tcp:5694:54"/>he might cary her with him to heauen, when he
departed out of this life. Of this I haue no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but it may be
piouſly beleeued according to that which is here related. I haue here told
this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, to declare ſomwhat of the zeale which Gregory had of the
ſaluation of ſoules, and to shew that the loue of God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which he did continually exerciſe was not a meere ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and built
only in the aire, but that the loſſe of ſoules ſpiritually went euen to
his heart, and that with all his ſtrength he did ſeeke their recouery,
though at his owne coſt, and by enduring the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishements due to another
ſins, as it ſeemes in this occaſion he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe which the
other should haue done; for beſides the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous paines of his body, which
he did ſuffer from his head to his feet, his inward torment was very
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, which he did vndergoe from the time that he tooke that 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5694:55"/>ſoule into his charge, in ſo much as that he did
wonder at himſelf, and he that neuer complained of any thing, in this time
did ſay with great feeling: Ieſus, God help me, what a Purgatory is this?
and once, as I was about to leaue him vpon ſome buſines he ſtayed me;
ſaying: keep me company. Truly the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ieſus Chriſt to his
Apoſtles keep me company, had in it a great miſtery; shewing by this, that
he found himſelf in his ſoule deſtitute of that ioy, wherwith our Lord
was vſed to comfort him in ſuch occaſions at other times; but the
ſtrength with which he did ſuffer this, the integrity of his faith, and the
confidence which he did put in God, was that which I did moſt admire at in
him: and becauſe his ordinary exerciſe after he went out to liue
ſolitary, was to reuiue that faith, and make a more ſtraight vnion of his
ſoule with God, therfore his heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in this kind, appeared clearly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5694:55"/>when occaſion was. I was wont to aske him in this his
laſt ſicknes, how he went on in the exerciſe of his continuall act of the
loue of God, and he allwaies, euen till his death, anſwered, that very well;
and, to make this more euident, I will here put downe in particular ſome
queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which I asked him when I ſaw him moſt troubled a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the
anſwers which he gaue me. I once asked him, whether ſo great paines did not
ſeparate him ſome what from God? he anſwered: not a iot; another time
ſeeing him much afflicted, I ſaid vnto him, now is your mind vpon God? he
ſaid and where should it be elſe? his death being neerer, whileſt he was
in his agony, I asked him; now are you well fixed vpon God? he ſaid, I am not
ill, vpon an other occaſion, haueing bin much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, he turned vnto me
and ſaid: Perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with peace auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much; and as I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted him,
ſaying, that our Lord did lead him <pb n="102" facs="tcp:5694:56"/>through croſſes,
as his beloued so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I am glad, ſaid he, I am glad that his will is fulfilled
in me. Laſtly when I thought it was time to giue him the holy candle, I
ſaide theſe wordes vnto him: now it is time to goe, and ſee the ſecret,
will you haue the candle (alluding to the hiſtory which he did know, of king
Alonſo the wiſe, who being in the like paſſage, ſaid, giue me that
candle, let vs goe ſee that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) wherunto Gregory made anſwer with a
wonderfull confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there is no ſecret, all is cleare, it is noone day
with me. This is not to be vnderſtood ſo, as that Gregory should ſay,
that at that inſtant he did ſee God cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for that kind of cleare
viſion hath ſeldome hapned in this life; the clearnes, which here he did
ſpeake of, is that of contemplation, which holy men doe call a cleare
knowledge, becauſe this light of contemplation ioyned with the generall light
of faith, cauſeth <pb n="103" facs="tcp:5694:56"/>ſuch a ſecurity, and a ſpeciall
kind of certainty of the diuine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, as that in compariſon of the
orainary knowledge of the faithfull, it is called a cleare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though
in reſpect of the cleare ſight of God, it be but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. Gregory
ſpoke of this clearnes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſaid, all is cleare, and, to ſay, that it was noone day with him, was no
great exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the light of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation goeth far beyond the
light of noone day: With this inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in poſſible for human frailty in this place of exile) he had allwaies
endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to exerciſe himſelf and excell. He died on ſaturday at
noone, on <pb n="104" facs="tcp:5694:57"/>the 20. of Iuly of the yeare 1596. vpon which
day the Order of the Carmelites doth ſolemniſe the feaſt of Elias the
firſt Father and Founder of the ſolitary life, which Gregory Lopes had ſo
perfectly obſerued. He liued 54. yeares, and 33. of them in ſolitude, His
body remained as if he had bin aliue, and, as we that were preſent did
conceit, with a certaine brightnes. At the ſame time wee felt a very
pleaſing ſmell, which came from his body, and remained in the chamber
wherin he died: and (which is more to be admired) his winding sheet kept the
ſame ſmell, and his cloaths doe retaine it till this day. It is allſo
worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that there being preſent at his death the Canon Nicolas
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinez Rectour of this place, and my ſelf, who had bin 20. yeares a
Curate, and three other deuout lay men, none of vs, did thinke of ſaying for
him a Reſponſory of the dead, ſuch was the ioy that we 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5694:57"/>did feele by ſeeing him, and was cauſed by his happy
paſſage. His body was laied in the Church of this village, by order, of the
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Iohn de Cerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Archbiſoprick, and now
Bishop of Guaxica, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Gregory his ſicknes whoſe
ſanctity was well knowne vnto him, came to viſit him ſome daies before
his death, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him that he would cauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be buried
where it should pleaſe the Archbishop of Mexico, or his Vicar Generall. He
ſpoke firſt with me about this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he talked with him, and I
anſwered him that at that time Gregory did not take any care for his buriall,
that all was at my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, deſiring indeed that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy should
remaine in the Church of Santafe; but I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine vntill I had
ſpoke with him; and telling Gregory what the Vicar Generall did require, he
ſaid theſe wordes: let the Vicar Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <pb n="106" facs="tcp:5694:58"/>his will be
done, for that is the will of God: and ſo this being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder witnes
before a Notary the Vicar Generall commanded that it should be buried in this
Church, yet ſo, as that it should be lawfull to tranſlate it to the
Cathedrall of Mexico when it pleaſed the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, prouiding hereby with
much prudence and mature iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, that if in proceſſe of time it should
pleaſe God to declare by miracles, how much he hath bin pleaſed by this his
ſeruant, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mexico might be honoured with the treaſure of his
holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There were preſent at his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralles many deuout perſons, and
of good account who had flocked thither from Mexico and other parts only for
that purpoſe, and brought with them torches and whatſoeuer elſe was
neceſſary for the better ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſing of the office, which was performed
by Don Alonſo de Motay Eſcouar Deane of the Church of Mexico, who was 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5694:58"/>then Bishop elect of Guadalaiara and now is of Tlaxcalla.
His body was enterred neare the high aultar on the ghoſpell ſide, and many
perſons that touched him 24. howers after his death found his limmes ſo
flexible as if he had bin aliue, though commonly dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as ſoone as
they become cold, vſe to grow ſtiffe ſo as their ioyntes cannot be
bended. Some ſay that God is wont to beſtow this gift and particular
priuiledge vpon virgins bodies, as it is likely that he was. At his buriall
allſo the foreſaid ſmell was felt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the peoples deuotion was
ſo increaſed, that they cutt off pieces of his garment very greedily,
thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues happy if they could but get any thing that was his. They
ſolemniſed his funeralls vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Annes day, and Doctour Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Ortis de

               <p>Gregory died to the eies of the world (I meane of Men addicted

not to goe ſo ſoone, becauſe your preſence is neceſſary for the

she told this reuelation to her ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who being certified of the
truth aduiſed her not to diuulge that which had bin reuealed vnto her, vntill
it pleaſed God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what was to be done: he did allſo counſaile
her to pray more earneſtly vnto God to aſſure her whether this was a

               <p>I haue bin told of a religious woman whoſe vertue and ſpirit

               <p>A child of three months old, the firſt and only ſon of his
pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (who were of the beſt ranke of Mexico) was ſick of a feauer not

of Gregory which was in the houſe, which being laid vpon the childs head, he
preſently fell aſleep, ſome howers after awaked, tooke the teate and was
well; his parentes, and thoſe that were preſent, gaue many thankes vnto God
and his <pb n="121" facs="tcp:5694:65"/>ſaint for this miracle.</p>
               <p>In the ſame city there was a Prieſt who was ſo troubled
with the toothache, as that for three daies and three nights he could not haue
one inſtant of reſt, and by reaſon of its vehemence his face was much
ſwelled; his mother gaue him a piece of Gregory his garment, and he with
faith and deuotion applying it to his cheeke, preſently fell a ſleep and
ſlept from nine of the clock at night vntill the next morning, and then
awaking he found the ſwelling of of his face aſſwaged, and himſelf
without any paine, attributing this ſodaine recouery to the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of this ſaint and giueing God thankes for it,</p>
               <p>In the houſe of a Gentleman of Mexico, a man well knowne in
this kingdome, there befell vnto a ſlaue of his ſuch a ſodaine accident
and great misfortune, as that all held him for dead of a vehement fit which he
had; a gentle woman <pb n="122" facs="tcp:5694:66"/>that was preſent calling to mind
that she had in her keeping a piece of the shirt in which Gregory dyed (which I
had giuen her) she cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little cofer to be brought her, and taking out
the ſaid relique, she laid it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſick mans fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and preſently
he came to himſelf againe whole and ſound, though with much a doe: and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked what he had felt, he anſwered; nothing. All that ſaw this
accident, with its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances could not but attribute this cure to a
miracle which our Lord wrought by his ſeruant Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Lopes.</p>
               <p>In the city de los Angelos an honourable Lady was brought to the
poinct of death by a violent feauer, which she fell into being great with child
and neare her time; but the infant dead in her wombe her husband ſeing her in
this danger, intreated a brother of the Conualeſcents by name Iohn Valleio to
viſit her; he went and <pb n="123" facs="tcp:5694:66"/>carried with him a little piece
of Gregory his garment, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the ſick womans neck ſaid vnto
her: put your hope in God and reuerence this relique of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Lopes, for by
his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you shall be reſtored to your health: it ſeemes she
did ſo, for being deliuered of that creature, she remained ſound.</p>
               <p>The ſaid brother applied the ſame Relique to a ſick woman
in the ſame towne, who had ſuch a grieuous headache, as that for a long
time she cried out continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both day and night: he wished her to put all
her confidence in God, and firmely to beleeue that he would giue her her
health, by the merits of Gregory Lopes. She preſently recouered rendring
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thankes vnto God, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deuout vnto him who by his
interceſſion had freed her from ſo great paine.</p>
               <p>In the city of Taxca a young man was infected with a pittifull 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5694:67"/>leproſi, and after he had tried ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny medicines, and
ſpent much in the curing of it, and all in vaine, a brother of the
Conualence<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts gaue him a little piece of Gregory his garment, bidding him apply
it to his neck, and take this ſeruant of God for his Patron with an
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope to be healed; and it came to paſſo, that within eight
daies he found himſelf cleare of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy, and diuulged this miracle,
publishing euery wherewith much gratitude, the wonderfull workes of God and the
praiſes of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</p>
               <p>In a village of this kingdome, called, Higualapa, a gentleman
had bin, for the ſpace of 16. months, troubled with a grieuous paine of the
collik, not haucing in all that time ſcarce a day nor hower free,
eſpecially the laſt twenty daies, in which his paine did not diminish a
whit nor giue him one minute of reſt As it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there was preſent a
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman <pb n="125" facs="tcp:5694:67"/>wife to the chiefe Iuſtice of that
prouince, who told him, that many miracles had bin wrought through the
deuotion, which thoſe of her houſe, did beare vnto Gregory Lopes, and that
if he, with the like faith, would make him his mediatour to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
goodnes, he might aſſure himſelf of his health. The ſick man hearing
this tooke a piece of Gregory his shirt, and applied it to the place where he
felt his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt paine, and holding it there a little while, he preſently
voided a ſtone of the bignes of a pine ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell. Herwith he recouered and
neuer after felt that paine, and held it for certaine, that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and
ſafety did befall him by the merits and interceſſion of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Lopes,
to whom he was euer after very deuout.</p>
               <p>A brother of the Conualeſcents, named Alonſo de la Fuente
was ſix yeares in the hoſpitall of Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteca, allmoſt allwaies ſiek,
full <pb n="126" facs="tcp:5694:68"/>of emplaſters and both legs full of holes and
corruption. The chiefe brother ſeing him ſo incurable, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that beſides
theſe and other ſores and paines, there was gowne in his forehead a
ſwelling as bigge as an egge, and another, not much leſſe in his anckle,
both very painefull, he remoued him to the hoſpitall in the Ilande, of S.
Iohn de Vlua, thinking that he would recouer in that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was of
a hotter temper. But it fell out quite contrary, for he grew much worſe by
reaſon of the moiſtnes of the ſea a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the cold north windes. This brother
being one day ſad and troubled in mind recommended himſelf to God and all
the ſaints, and earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Gregory Lopes to obtaine him his
health; and remembring himſelf of ſome reliques of his which were giuen him
at Guaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, he applied them to his head with a night cap and to his leg
with bandes, throwing the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſters <pb n="127" facs="tcp:5694:68"/>and patches, which
he wore, into the ſea, and in three or foure daies after he had applied the
ſaid reliques he found himſelf perfectly cured of all his diſeaſes,
ſwellings and ſores without any other medicine, and he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer troubled
with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards, wherby he plainly perceiued the force and efficacy of
Gregory his interceſſion.</p>

in his owne Mothers tongue; then tranſlated them out of another. He had by
heart all the hiſtoricall part of the Scripture, of the Ghoſpell of S.
Matthew and S. Iohn word by word, and thoſe things which were ſaid by the
other two Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts more then was by theſe; the Epiſtles allſo of S.
Paul and the Apocalips. To conclude he had ſuch a perfect knowledge of all
the holy Scripture, that being asked of any place or ſentence whatſoeuer,
he anſwered with incredible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines and certainty.</p>
               <p>Father Peter de Prauia, being Vicar Generall of this

of his. <hi>Beatus homo quem tu erudieris Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> Pſal. 39.</p>
               <p>Certaine religious Men very learned, being in Santafe ſpoke a
ſentence as out of Scripture, in his preſence and he ſaid: that is not
Scripture; they much wondering hereat looked into the bible, and found that he
had ſaid true. It was a thing worth admiration how certainly he knew in how
many places of the holy Scripture, this thing, or that thing was ſaid? or
whether it was in it or no? to this purpoſe a religious man a publick reader
of the Scripture, and one that had conuerſed with him, ſaid vnto me (as one
that knew him) theſe wordes: I doe not talke with any man about the holy
Scripture with ſuch warines, as I doe with Gregory Lopes.</p>
               <p>Certaine prebends being in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, told of another 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:5694:70"/>that was preſent, how that he knew all the Pſalter by
heart: he anſwered; that which is to be eſteemed is, if he can make vſe
of it when it is requiſite; for in this he was ſingular, that he could call
to mind both the thinges which he knew and their places when it was
needfull.</p>
               <p>Ther were ſome Preachers, who haueing occaſion to retire
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to Santafe, when they were to make a ſermon, were vſed to
ſay, that they needed not their Concordances where Gregory was.</p>
               <p>Don Pedro Moya de Contreras viſiting his Archbishoprick, came
to Guaſteca where Gregory did liue at that time, and ſent vnto him by me to
aske a doubt, wherunto he anſwered ſo profundly as that I did not dare to
bring him the anſwer, but re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ning with the meſſage, I ſaid vnto him; I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that
you would heare Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his reaſons from his owne <pb n="132" facs="tcp:5694:71"/>mouth
then from mine, and ſo he will anſwer you when you goe to ſee him. When
the Archbishop had bin with him, and heard him, he remained well ſatisfied
and much amaſed, and ſaid vnto me: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought that he knew ſo
much.</p>
               <p>Father Dominick de Salazar, who died being firſt Archbishop of
the Philippines, ſpoke in this manner of Gregory twenty yeares before his
death, in the preſence of three graue and learned reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men of the order
of S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick: how is this Fathers, that we, with all that we haue got by
ſtudying in all our life, know not half ſo much as this young man doth?</p>
               <p>Many learned perſons, that came to aske him doubts out of the
holy Scripture, returned well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and amaſed at the great
knowledge, which it had peaſed God to beſtow vpon this his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>GOd did not onely teach this his beloued ſcholler the holy
Scripture; as is ſaid, but alſo, and in a more excellent degree, he
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in a ſpirituall courſe. which he was to follow in a
moſt eminent manner, and was allſo to <pb n="134" facs="tcp:5694:72"/>be a guide and
Maſter to others. For this holy man by the light of his vnderſtanding, knew
his owne perſon, and, as far as I could vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, he did ſee as
diſtinctly his owne ſpirit with the eies of his vnderſtanding, as he did
his body with thoſe of his body, and he did clearely diſcerne thoſe two
ſprings, of his body, and his ſoule, which riſe vp ſo mingled the one
with the other, reſtrayning the current of the body, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that of
the ſpirit, which is very rare; for it is a very hard thing, and ſuch as
few attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to diſtinguish in ones ſelf, the workes that proceed
from grace, from thoſe that proceed from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe oftentimes the
one are masked with the liknes of the others; Gregory diſcerned theſe very
well, both in himſelf, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that asked him counſaile in the like
doubts.</p>
               <p>It once ſo fell out with me, that haueing bin, for ſome
months <pb n="135" facs="tcp:5694:72"/>ſpace, only exerciſed in mentall prayer, wherin
I found great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and trouble, I had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes occaſion to goe
about a certaine worke of charity, and by the way I felt ſuch an inward ioy
and tranquillity of mind, that in thoſe daies me thought I was in heauen.
Afterwardes returning to Santafe and giueing him account of what had paſt, I
told him that my ſpirit had dilated it ſelf very much; he anſwered me:
Father Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa it was your nature that dilated it ſelf: I did beleeue him,
though at that time I did not vnderſtand it; but aſſiſted through the
mercy of God by his prayers, ſoone after I attained to this verity: for I was
wont to doe outward workes of charity, which though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they be
vertuous and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, yet haue this property, that they recreate and
dilate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſometimes ſelf loue creeps in; but in that recollection
I did only vſe mentall prayer, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <pb n="136" facs="tcp:5694:73"/>the which, nature
was as it were in a continuall torment and rack, becauſe she was withheld
from thoſe exerciſes, wherin she was vſed to find content and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
though holy and good; of which kind are theſe; to relieue the
neceſſities, and ſeeke the good of ones neighbour, to heare and ſpeake
of heauenly things (for theſe haue bin my employments by the grace of God,
for ſome yeares) but when I left of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, to doe that worke of
charity which I ſpoke of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created my ſelf with the ſight of the
fieldes and hills, nature did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her former caſe and quietnes, ſo
as she made no war againſt the ſpirit, wherwith I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiued much content,
thinking that now I was at peace with my ſelf; but afterwardes, when I
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to returne to my ſole men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall exerciſes. I found that nature
had got more ſtrength then euer to war againſt the ſpirit, and
percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <pb n="137" facs="tcp:5694:73"/>by this manifeſtly, that this my peace was
not: ſo much of the ſpirit as of nature, I came to ſee by euident
conſequence, that Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory knew my ſpirit better then I my ſelf did.</p>
               <p>Certaine religious men talking in his preſence, of things
which did help ones ſpirit and deuotion, one of them ſaid, that muſick
did much auaile, for he, by heareing once eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſong in the great Church at
Mexico found his ſpirit ſo reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as that he had neuer ſaid his
prayers before with ſuch peace and quietnes. Another ſaid, that it auailed
much to pray in company with others becauſe the difficulty, which he found in
praying in his Cell, was diminished, and taken away by the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and example
of thoſe, that did pray with him. Gregory let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe away without
ſpeaking a word vnto them about that matter. I did perceiue that he could
eaſily haue freed them from their errour, and shewed them that 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5694:74"/>it is nature that is helpt and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by thoſe
meanes, and not the ſpirit, as might be ſeene by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe which
I had; and becauſe the reaſon, why ſome in prayer doe help themſelues
with the company of others, is becauſe our nature is quickned, and taketh
delight, that her good workes are ſeen, as may be ſeen in thoſe, who take
a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and giue almes in publick; therfore ſuch as thoſe following
the content of nature, pray better in company then alone. I asked him what was
the reaſon, that he did not aduiſe and inſtruct thoſe religious men in
this, he anſwered me; becauſe that were to hinder their iourney, for with
that ſtaffe they goe on a little, and without it they would ſit downe.</p>
               <p>Our Lord had giuen him a great quicknes of iudgment in
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghts or words which, was idle, and which not; and in
ſpeaking of God he could very well diſcerne, when it proceeded 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:5694:74"/>from nature; and when from God: to this purpoſe he was
vſed to ſay: many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe ſpeake of God more through loue of themſelues
then of God, ſometimes allſo he ſaid: the loue of God is all in workes,
it hath but few wordes, and oftentimes it is dumbe. From this knowledge
proceeded that rare moderation of his tongue, as shall be ſaid in its, proper
place.</p>
               <p>From hence allſo it came to paſſe that he neuer had any
ſcruples, but an admirable quietnes of mind; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no leſſe certainty in
matters of faith, wherin he neuer had any doubts, notwithſtanding his great
temptations, and this is that which he meant at the hower of his death, when
being asked whether he would haue the holy candle, to goe and ſee the
ſecret, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great courage, as is ſaid before, all is
cleare, there is nothing ſecret, it is noone day with me; wherin his meaning
was not that his faith had no obſcurity in it, but <pb n="140" facs="tcp:5694:75"/>that
he had no doubt in matetrs belonging vnto it; for our faith is obſcure, yet
ſo, as it is allſo moſt certaine, and the certainty of it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not
away its obſcurity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord will haue vs walke in this life,
captiuating our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in his ſeruice, as ſaith the
Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>I haue thought conuenient to put downe ſome examples, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the greatnes of the light which Gregory had, might be gathered, ſince that
with it he knew, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelf and his owne ſpirit, but allſo other
mens. I had great ſignes and coniectures (by thoſe things which had hapned
vnto me) to perſwad my ſelf, that he did ſee other mens ſoules: being
of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I asked him one day about fiue yeares or more before his
death, if it were true, that he did ſee them, he anſwered, no; with this
ſo plain an anſwer I beleeued him, and reſted ſatisfied, but I
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day forwardes, <pb n="141" facs="tcp:5694:75"/>he grew euery
day more wary, therfore I ſpoke no more vnto him of that matter, but ſince,
I haue had, and now haue ſo many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſo worthy of credit, and
ſuch as none can except againſt, that I thinke I should doe ill in not
affirming it for certaine; and if he ſaid that he did not ſee them, that is
to be attributed to his great humility and wiſedome which made him ſeeke to
conceale that gift of God, as he did many others: neither is it to be thought,
that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo true and perfect did tell a ly, for his denying of it in this
caſe, might be ſaued from a ly by many waies. Firſt it might be that at
that time, God had not as yet done him that fauour, but that he did it him
afterwardes towardes the end of his life. It might be allſo that at that
inſtant, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I askt him that queſtion, he did not ſee the ſoules, but
that God gaue him light, to ſee them at other times, when it was
neceſſary, for the light of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation <pb n="142" facs="tcp:5694:76"/>of
ſpirituall things is not habituall and permanent, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actuall, ſuch
as is that of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which God giueth and taketh away as he pleaſeth. And
ſo at that time, when Gregory ſaid that he did not ſee them (though he
did ſee them in other occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) it is to be vnderſtood that he did not
ſee them, becauſe God had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away that light from him at that
preſent.</p>
               <p>A certaine perſon of quality told Gregory, that he had had
great temptations, but he hoped in God he had not committed any ſinne in
them, and therfore that he had not reuealed them in confeſſion. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
replied: not ſo ſtoutly, for truely you haue bin but a weake ſouldiour;
then the other ſaid: then doe you thinke it good I should confeſſe them?
Gregory anſwered, he did not thinke that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any great fault in
doing as he did, but to haue made an entire reſiſtance he should haue done 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:5694:76"/>ſuch and ſuch things; hereby the other, not only
gathered that he had ſeen his ſpirit, but allſo learnt the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of
reſiſting better, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.</p>
               <p>A godly Prieſt came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a place far diſtant vnto Gregory to
be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of ſome doubts concerning his ſoule; and he anſwered him,
ſo to his purpoſe as the Prieſt ſaid: you haue told me that which I
thought to haue askt you, and which I had great need to be told of; Gregory
replied: God ſeing your neceſſity moued my tongue to ſpeake that which
you heard.</p>
               <p>There came to viſit Gregory a lawyer, who then was maried and
now is a religious man, but was allwaies a vertuous man, and by the way he
talked with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion about certaine thinges tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his ſoule, which
neither Gregory nor any other man did know, or could know by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
meanes, and as ſoone as they came vnto him before they asked 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:5694:77"/>him of any of thoſe things, of which they intended to
talk with him he anſwered them ſo directly to all thinges, as that they
remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſatisfied and amayſed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one vpon the other, rendred
thankes vnto God, ſeing him anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer them ſo directly, as if he had bin
asked, whervpon the lawyer tooke occaſion to examine his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as
often as he went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Gregory, thinking that he ſaw the moſt
ſecret thoughts of his heart; and after the ſame manner going at other
times to aske his counſaile, he anſwered him ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly before he
ſpoke euer a word, as that he was confirmed in the opinion, which he had of
him:</p>
               <p>A religious man of a very ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life and very familiar
with Gregory; went one euening to aske him ſome doubts about his ſpirit,
and becauſe it was allmoſt night, and he had not the time, which he
deſired, to treate of that <pb n="145" facs="tcp:5694:77"/>buſines, he bid him goe
take his reſt, and that the next morning they would talke of it. The
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man being that night in his chamber which was vnder the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man
his lodging, receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly an anſwer from God of that which he intended
to aske, and a check for comming to aske counſaile of a creature, when he
might haue it from the Creatour, for that he that had giuen Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch
ſtore, would allſo giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if he would diſpoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for
it, and put his confidence in God; as ſoone as it was morning, he went vnto
Gregory his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who ſmiled as ſoone as he ſaw him, and the
religious man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell him how that God that night had anſwered his
doubts: Gregory helpt him out to tell it, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d preuenting him, for as yet he had
not told of the reprehenſion, he ſaid theſe wordes vnto him: and had you
not a good reprehenſion for ſeeking counſaile of a creature, 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:5694:78"/>he anſwered, yes, father, I had a reprehenſion
allſo. At all this he maruailed very much, and aſſured himſelf that the
holy man had ſeen in God all that had paſt with him.</p>
               <p>Another Prieſt very carefull in things concerning his
ſpirit, came to ſee Gregory Lopes, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him diligently,
perceiued that this ſeruant of God ſpoke to him of all that was in his
heart, which though Gregory himſelf did neue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſo, for that his ſoule ſomewhat inordinately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the great fauours
which he had receiued, and which he did hope to receiue from the hand of God;
Gregory among other things ſaid vnto him: wee looke for great matters, but
truly either here, or there we muſt pay for our ſmall humility.</p>
               <p>A cortaine perſon deuout vnto our Lady was vſed to ſay his

him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well profited in mentall prayer, he asked Gregory whether it
were not beſt to leaue off the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that he might giue himſelf the

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fauours ſtill continued in his ſoule, as one now alltogether ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
he determined to leaue of the roſary without acquainting Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory with it;
but within few daies after he left it off, he began to feele many troubles and
drouths, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <pb n="148" facs="tcp:5694:79"/>no prayer (for to theſe da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers
he expoſeth himſelf, who thinketh to make a proſperous nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the
ſpirituall life, without Mary the ſtarre of the ſea) he told this vnto
the holy man without telling him the reaſon, which was his leauing off of the
roſary; wherat Gregory ſmiling ſaid vnto him: fall to your beades againe;
he did ſo, and it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo well with him, as that in a short time he
came to haue the ſame ſpirit and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he was wont to haue; whervpon
he was euer after very deuout vnto our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered much, that Gregory
did knowe the cauſe of his drouth, though he had concealed it.</p>
               <p>It once hapned that there met at Santafe ſix ſpirituall men
or more at the ſame time, who came from diuers parts to confer with Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of matters concerning their ſoule, and ſometimes he anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all in
publick, and that ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially as that they were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in
their doubts, and inſtructed <pb n="149" facs="tcp:5694:79"/>in what they were ignorant
of; but that which I moſt admired at, was to ſee in how few wordes he
anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, for he did reſolue great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in two or three wordes,
and me thought thoſe wordes were as lawes in the mindes of the heares, and
ſparcles deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a burning charity; ſo as they went away not only
illuminated, but allſo with their hearts inflamed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtirred vp to embrace
whatſoeuer was good.</p>
               <p>There came vnto Gregory one exceedingly troubled in mind and
told him all his troubles; he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him only theſe wordes: this is a
purgatory wherin God detaineth you, and theſe were of force to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him,
and giue him great quietnes of mind.</p>
               <p>He comforted another Prieſt much afflicted, only by ſaying
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that of the Apocalips: I counſaile thee to buy of me tried and
burning gold, wherwith thou maiſt be rich.</p>
               <p>Another found comfort amongſt <pb n="150" facs="tcp:5694:80"/>his
tribulations and temptations, by hearing him ſay: the kingdome of heauen
ſuffereth violence and the valiant doe win it.</p>
               <p>To knights and great perſons that deſiring to liue well in
their ſtate, did aske him what they should doe, he ſaid: That which you doe
for the loue of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

enough.</p>
               <p>To lawyers, indges, and men of emploiment, he was vſed to
ſay change your intention and you will doe much.</p>
               <p>With theſe kinds of ſpeeches he did awake ſome that were a
ſleep who by hearing him came to the ſelues and profited very much of this
efficacy and good effects of his wordes (which I did allwaies, attribute to his
prayers) we shall ſpeake ſome thing in the 19. and 20. Chapters, beſides
that which is ſpoke of in diuerſe places of this booke and might be
ſpoken of more at large.</p>
               <p>Haueing by long obſeruation <pb n="151" facs="tcp:5694:80"/>perceiued,
that Gregory did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſpiritually, whatſoeuer he ſpoke or heard
I once ſaid vnto him: whatſoeuer you ſpeake or heare, you vnderſtand it
ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he anſwered me, that it was true; wherby ſpirituall men
may ſee the perſeuerance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his ſpirit, and thoſe that
are not, will perceiue it by theſe examples following.</p>
               <p>If any Man did ſay that the bread of Santafe was good, he

beholding the ſprings and ſtreames of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which run from hence to

that receiueth them after they haue paſſed through human vnderſtandings;
when he heard men ſay; ſuch an one is of a noble houſe, he preſently
conſidered that true nobility was to be a ſon of God in ſpirit; if any
one ſaid that ſuch a Lord or ſuch a Lord was grandy of Spaine, he
preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the chiefe greatnes was to be a freind of God, a

(when there was occaſion of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any thing, which was hard to be

               <p>Father Manuell de Reinoſo, a holy man, and very great Preacher
of the order of S. Francis admiring <pb n="156" facs="tcp:5694:83"/>at the vnderſtanding

haue asked him of diuerſe places in the Scripture, and there was none to
which he gaue not a very good anſwer; once I asked him nine of the hardeſt
places which I haue ſeene in all the bible, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them to me in a

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearing him ſay ſo went vnto Gregory with other
places of great difficulty, and found by experience, that, what had bin ſaid
of him, was true. He knew (with as much euidence as can be gathered out of the
holy Scripture a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other hiſtories) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer paſt, ſince the
creation of the world to Noe, telling the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of the ſons of God,
and of our firſt fathers ſo diſtinctly, as that without looking in the

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5694:83"/>and the differences of the times and ages, allthough it be
a thing ſo obſcure euen to the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; neither was he ignorant of
things that paſt the ſons of men at that time, whoſe cuſtomes and

the comeing of Chriſt, and he ſpoke of thoſe times and perſons, as if
he had liued in them. Hauing ſpoke of this family of God, he diſcourſed
of the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nations, putting all into one hiſtory, and accommodating
theſe hiſtories to the times and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the ſaid family; and
he did not only know the warres and other thinges that hapned in the family of
God, but allſo thoſe of the Gentills vntill the comeing of our Redeemer,
and in my opinion he knew all this as exactly as any other man of his time: He
had by heart the Prophecies of all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billes, he would tell many
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the birth, infancy, child. <pb n="158" facs="tcp:5694:84"/>hood, youth of
our ſauiour Chriſt; and allſo of his preaching, death, and the other
myſteries, and how much the law of grace excelleth the law of nature and the
law written. He had in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eies the life and preaching of the
holy Apoſtles, and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. He related in particular the liues and
Martyrdomes of the Popes and other famous martyrs from S. Peeter to S.
Sylueſter, and the moſt remarkable liues and deeds of the Confeſſours
of moſt note from S. Sylueſter to Clement the eighth, in whoſe time he
died. He told the names, time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of the founders of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
orders, and of ſolitary life, and of the Archereticks, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their

ended.</p>
               <p>He diſcourſed very particularly of the hiſtory of that
beaſt, which <pb n="159" facs="tcp:5694:84"/>S. Iohn ſpeakeh of in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips,
which was the city of Rome, and of the ten hornes, which were the ten
Emperours, who did moſt of all perſecute the Church, and he did bring downe
this hiſtory of the Emperours to Phillip the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in whoſe time he
died.</p>
               <p>He did ſpeake very diſtinctly of the beginnings and

               <p>He was allſo very conuerſant in the hiſtories of the

Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer, Coſmographer and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher. He had a globe and a map made
with his owne handes very truly and exactly, for I haue heard skillfull men,
that haue ſeen it praiſe it as ſuch; but that which I moſt wondred at,
is, that oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when there was occaſion, I askeing him about diuers
parts of the earth, euen of the Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, he anſwered me preſently,

               <p>He was allſo very skillfull in Phyſick, of which he writ a

delight which he tooke in this art was to make receits, which he gaue to the
poore and needy, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his owne hand, with the beſt remedies, which the
deſire that he had of his neighbours health, did make him inuent and
compoſe, for he was very compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate; and thefore God gaue vnto him
wonderfull ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>He was likewiſſe very skillfull in husbandry, and was
allſo an herbaliſt, for he did not only know the properties and vertue of
hearbs but allſo how to make them better, with ſundry liquors which he

changed by his hand, as that they ſeemed of another kind; and he told me that
if he did know of any man that were curious, and a good Chriſtian (leaſt
that, if he wanted the feare of God, he should make them worſe and poiſon
them by this art) he would teath him this art, for the profit of his

               <p>He was a very good penman, and did write many kindes off hands
ſingular well, at this day there are ſome things in this kind, of his

ſo as hauing his eies allwaies fixed vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, all was but the
ſame water vnto him.</p>
               <p>I will relate his manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bookes, as a thing more
then naturall; it fell out ſome times that in ten howers ſpace he would
haue read ouer a booke, which others reading neuer ſo ſaſt would ſcarce
haue ended in a month and becauſe ſome will ſay, that he did that by his
great memory, and apprehending of things only by ſeeing the title of the
chapter; I will bring an example in a matter well knowne: for that anſwer
might haue place in bookes, of common reading, but not of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things,
ſuch as is that of the holy Mother Tereſa de Ieſus, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:5694:88"/>which as I thinke he read ouer in twenty howers, and yet knew ſo
well all that was contained in it, as there was ſcarce any man that knew more
of it, then Gregory did; and I haue often made triall of this; for I haue
ſometimes told him of very ſmall and particular thinges out of that booke,
and he hath continued on in the bookes diſcourſe, as if he had bin reading
it: when he did read to others, his celerity, clearnes of pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
grace in reading was very notable.</p>
               <p>Our Lord endued Gregory with an exceeding great vnderſtanding,
quick apprehenſion, and ſuch a sharp memory, as that I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard
him ſay, that he neuer forgot any thing which he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to keep in mind,
and with ſoe perfect a will that it is very credible, that his continuall
exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, was to be allwaies in an act of the loue of God.</p>
               <p>As for his ſtature we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <pb n="167" facs="tcp:5694:88"/>him of
the higheſt, well proportioned, without any defect, he was not ſtrong, but
rather of a tender conſtitution; ſo as in his latter yeares he was
allmoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but skin and bone. The haire of his head, beard, and
eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes of hazellnut colour, his forehead ſomewhat large, and hanging out,
his eiebrowes full and arched, and without any ſpace betwixt them, his eares
little, yet it is ſtrange, how well he did heare, his eies black ſomewhat
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to green, he had allwaies a very quicke ſight, ſo as he could
reade the leaſt print without ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, though after that ague we
ſpoke of, he ſometimes put them on to ſee a far off; his noſe rather
little then great, his lips thin and equall, but that his vnder-lip did a
little ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g out; his teeth very white and euen; his beard well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not
bushey nor great; his face long, ſomwhat pale and wan, ſo 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5694:89"/>were his hands allſo by reaſon of his abſtinence,
prayer, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall mortification. This good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition and

and repreſentation of the great beauty of his ſoule.</p>

               <p>IF the holy Ghoſt approueth him for a perfect man that doth

ſince that in eighteen yeares wherin I conuerſed familiarly with him, I
neuer heard hin ſpeake one worde amiſſe. Herof I can giue euident
teſtimony, for ſince that I made choice of him euen from the beginning, for
a Maſter and companion for the reſt of my life, and that only for his
vertue, without any hope of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall gaine or intereſt, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that I had reaſon to be carefull that he whom I choſe for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of
vertue, were free from all ſpot of vice. Beſides, I was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by wiſe
and graue men to be wary, and liue very circumſpect, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:5694:90"/>hereunto allſo I was moued by the deſire of Gods honour and
Gregory his good motiues of themſelues ſufficient to be carefull, becauſe
the diuine maieſty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs all, to haue as much care as we can of our
neighbours good: yet notwithſtanding all this care and diligence that ſuch
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues require, I neuer heard him ſpeake a word worthy of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
againſt any man neither heathen nor heretick; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the ſect or
hereſi with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grounds out of Scripture, and reprehended their vices and
ſins wherwith they had ſo blinded themſelues as not to returne to the
boſome of the Catholick Church, from which they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
themſelues, but he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the parties names.</p>
               <p>When he was told of any that ſpoke ill of him, he heard it
very peaceably and midly; and the firſt thing that he anſwered was; as for
the firſt, it is certaine that this <pb n="171" facs="tcp:5694:90"/>party hath a good
intention, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes he excuſed him as well as he could; and he did not
only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the party himſelf, but allſo his fact without excuſing
himſelf at all.</p>
               <p>A graue perſonage perſwaded one of the Bishops that liue in
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xico, to goe and ſee Gregory by the way, as he went about the Marqueſate
of Valle, where Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory did liue, aſſuring him, that he would be very glad
to haue ſeen a man ſo admirable for his ſanctity and wiſdome. Herevpon
the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop reſolued with himſelf, and went to ſee him; Gregory came out
with much courteſy, reſpect a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d humility to receiue the Bishop, and after
they were both ſate downe, and thoſe allſo that came in his company,
diuerſe things were talked of, but Gregory was not asked any thing, and
therfore he ſpoke not a word; ſo when the Bishop had bin there about a
quarter of an hower, being told it <pb n="172" facs="tcp:5694:91"/>was dinner time, he
went away. Some daies after, the ſame man going to giue the Bishop the
well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at his returne to his Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prick, and asking him what he thought of
Gregory he anſwered that he ſeemed to him a ſenſles foole, maruailing
at this anſwer he asked him if he had talked with him of ſpirituall
thinges? the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop anſwered no, then he, I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not, ſaid he that
not being asked he did not ſpeake, and not ſpeaking did not show what he
had in him. He shewed it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well afterwardes, when the ſame man telling
him that the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop had accounted him a foole, he reioyced and ſaid: I
should haue thought ſo too iff I had ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man of my fashion, and this was
not much for Gregory, becauſe God hadgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a moſt ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue of his
neighbour, the which he was vſed to ſay, conſiſteth not in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, nor
in ſaying, I wish my neighbour well, but in doing him <pb n="173" facs="tcp:5694:91"/>good turnes.</p>
               <p>I neuer heard him ſpeake an idle word, neither in ſeing the
heauens cleare and beſet with ſtarres, nor in ſeing the fiedls green, or
bedec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with flowers, or the chryſtall waters, neither in the viſits of
any whatſoeuer, nor at the table, or afterwardes; and I doe not call an idle
worde that which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort meaneth, that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnſeemly
or tending to ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillity, for ſuch as theſe were not to be ſpoke, nor
thought off in ſuch a life as Gregory did leade; here I call an idle word, as
diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſpirituall men meane, a needleſſe one, and ſuch an one was
neuer heard from his mouth for he did ſo ſquare and meaſure his
diſcourſes as that words nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted, nor were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
               <p>I will note here an other thing for the learned, it hapned
ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that there were in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſome learned men talking of 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:5694:92"/>ſciences wherin he was moſt eminent, yet he held his
peace, as if he had bin a clowne and ignorant, vnleſſe he were asked, or in
other reſpects which I will ſpeak off by and by. This was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally knowne
and Dom Fray Pedro de Agurto Bishop of Cibu in the Philippines a man knowne in
this kingdome, not only for his dignity but allſo for his great wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome,
religion and ſanctity, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it in a letter of his in theſe wordes. I
loued very much, my good and holy Gregory, and if I left of conuerſing with
him, the reaſon was, becauſe he not being vſed to ſpeake vnleſſe he
were aske, and I haueing the title of a Maſter though ſtanding in need of
that which I might learne from ſo good and ſo well practiſed a ſoule,
it might be that my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and conuerſation might be thought
impertinent, though it could not be imagined by ſuch an one as he.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:5694:92"/>That which I did moſt admire at in
Gregory, is that all though it be ſo commendable a thing to ſpeake of God
and that many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and vertuous perſous came from countries far

yet he neuer tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to them of God, nor of ſpirit, or morality, vnleſſe
he were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and when he did anſwer, though his anſwers were profund and
admirable, yet he ſpoke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exaggeration in a very plaine ſtile,
and cut off his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as ſoone as he had ſatisfied the
queſtions and neceſſitie of his neighbour, and as it happened often that
to the queſtion which he did anſwer there did belong foure or fiue more,
which the ſtanders by would aske of him, he anſwered euery one ſo

then he thought was neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It is a thing truly worthy of much conſideration, that he

               <p>Another time ſtanding at the window, and ſeing it raine

lightning ſell vpon my hand, as I held it out of the window, I told it vnto
Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, and of the paine that I felt; he anſwered: you are well ſerued,
ſince that you ſpeake wordes that are not neceſſary, for I ſee that
it raines apace.</p>
               <p>Haueing one day told me a thing wherwith I was very much
edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I asked him why he did not tell it me before if he knew it, he
anſwered: I doe not tell that <pb n="178" facs="tcp:5694:94"/>which I know, but that
which is neceſſary: and vpon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſaid for two yeares

I ſaw onely once in foure and twenty howers.</p>
               <p>He did not only keep ſilence in ſpeaking, but, alſo in

that which is in the I. chapter of this booke. He wrote ſome to <hi>Don Luys
de Velaſco</hi> the Viceroy in anſwer of others, and he did no more but
anſwer at the end of the Viceroies letter: I will doe that, which in this you
command me, which was for the moſt part to recommend ſome buſineſſes
to God. And though worldly men <pb n="179" facs="tcp:5694:94"/>account this manner of
anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially to princes, rude and vnmannerly; yet in one that was
ſo far from compliments and ſo wary in his ſpeech as Gregory was, it was
great prudence and heauenly wiſdome.</p>
               <p>He did only ſpeake without being asked, when he vndertooke the
defence of the honour of God or of his neighbour, or of the truth of the holy
ſcripture and our holy Catholick faith; and this too when no body elſe
preſent vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the buſines. For example: if any one was afflicted with
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations or ſicknes; by reaſon of which he did ſeeme in ſome ſort
to murmure at God, one would not thinke with what pious and graue ſpeeches,
he would indeauour to bring him into knowledge of his owne errour, ignorance,
and of the bottomles Ocean of the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne wiſdome and mercy which was hidde
vnder thoſe tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and how much he was <pb n="180" facs="tcp:5694:95"/>bound
vnto God; and to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his more then fatherly hands. He did allſo
defend his neighbour with very prudent reaſons as shall be ſeen in the next
Chapter.</p>
               <p>That wherin he shewed moſt ſpirit and vigour was in
expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome places of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, vpon which miſunderſtood
the heretickes had grounded their errours, and in ſuch occaſions he did not
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent himſelf with bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome few authorities and reaſons, but he
dilated himſelf as much as he could, and alleaged the beſt ſenſes that
he could of the holy ſcripture; and in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the heretickes
ſaid contradicted one another, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſed the ſame vigour and
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, yet withall mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, ſor he did eſteeme it as his
owne Mother, hauing bin brought vp ſo many yeares att her breaſts.</p>

               <p>HE did heare very peaceably and midly, and with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
whatſoeuer was asked of him, and with the ſame mildnes let it paſſe, or
anſwered it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he thought conuenient or neceſſary.</p>
               <p>There came to this village to viſit Gregory, a religious man
Doctour off Diuinitie, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to get him to ſpeake ſome thing of
God: I did ſo, and the Doctour, to giue him play began to treate of that
matter with a great number of reaſons and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; and the holy man being a
great while ſilent, I intreated him by ſignes to talke ſome thing of God
wherunto he anſwered ſoftly ſo as the Doctour did not heare, 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5694:96"/>becauſe he was ſomewhat deafe: ſilence edifieth him
more then ſpeaking; and allthourgh he ſtaied there two daies and one night
yet Gregory did not ſpeake vnto him one word of God. As the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour was
going away, I asked him, what, he thought of Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he ſaid: his ſilence
pleaſeth me very much and Gregory himſelf ſaid vnto me afterwardes:
Father Loſa, I ſee that many can ſpeake well, lett vs doe well. If any
one by way of diſputation, or to try him, did aske him ſomething, which he
had premeditated, and ſtudied before hand, putting vnto him his doubt in
Latine, he would ſay. I praytell it me in Spanish: that being done, the holy
man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: this is that which you ſay; giueing him to vnderſtand that
ther was no need of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He was alſo wont to aske of learned men,
the ſignification of the holy ſcripture in Spanish, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to humble

               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:5694:96"/>To thoſe that asked him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
about going to ſpaine, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, or ſuch like thinges, he gaue no anſwer
for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſaid that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it vnto God;
wherin he shewed great wiſdome; for he knew that in ſuch buſineſſes
it was conuenient, that God should diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the meanes, and moue the
willes, to that which was for his greater glory, and the good of men, and this
was the reaſon why he would not anſwer, without firſt treating with God
of thoſe thinges: beſides he thought it not à matter of any great
importance, whether men did mary or goe for ſpaine, but he kept vnto
himſelf, out of his humility and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe and other good
reaſons, that moued him to giue no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But when any asked him whether
they should be prieſts, or enter into religion, if he did find they had parts
requiſite for ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n eſtate,
he did further them in <pb n="184" facs="tcp:5694:97"/>their reſolution of embracing
that principall good, but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that they wanted thoſe parts, he
anſwered as is ſaid; I will recommend it vnto God.</p>
               <p>He would ſpeake very much in behalf of the religious orders,
and of the Prelates and Superiours of them in preſence of their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
and thoſe of their charge and houſe declaring vnto them how great a good it
was to obey and obſerue their rules and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Vnto lay-men, when occaſion was offered, he gaue to
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the eminence of a religious mans eſtate aboue theirs, and the
great ſpirit wherwith the religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were founded; he ſaid that Gods

that a tree in a plaine field needeth take good roote, but that it is more
ſafe from the violence of the winds in a woody mountaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:5694:97"/>He did all waies defend Princes,
Gouernours, Iudges, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall as Secular, with great courage
and humility withall, in preſence of their ſubiects: and when they did
murmure at the gouernment, he ſaid: if you were in the place, it may be you
would not doe ſo well as he that is in gouernment; and if they ſtood in it
ſaying, that that which the Princes did, diſerued to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he
replied: you should tell them ſo, for what good doth it here? to ſome that
eſteemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſpirituall men, and yet did murmure, he ſaid: I

murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth at his neiggbour. Moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he was vſed to ſay in ſuch
occaſions: this thing cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied here, let vs not talke of it; and
with his grauity he gaue ſuch life and authority to his wordes, as that a man
of great account who talked of the kings gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was <pb n="186" facs="tcp:5694:98"/>put much out of countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, only by hearing Gregory ſay vnto him
the king hath as sharp an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as any man in ſpaine, and will you
reprehend him? and the ſame man doth yet admire at the great change which
thoſe wordes cauſed in him.</p>
               <p>He made another allſo who ſpoke ill of the gouernment of a
Lord, change his opinion, only by ſaying vnto him: you dare not ſay ſo in
his preſence.</p>
               <p>He was very conſiderate and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed in ſpeaking to euery
one in his proper kind, to the husband man, ſouldier, gentelman and the
reſt, without taking any man out of his profeſſion; and to this
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he commended very much S. Iohn Baptiſts wiſdome in the
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile that he gaue to the ſouldier, to be content with his pay, and

               <p>Treating with ſpirituall men, leaſt they should iudge

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:5694:98"/>theirs,
as ſometimes it vſeth to fall out, he was wont to ſay, that he was much
delighted with the variety of mens ſpirits, becauſe that with them God did
beautify his heauenly Hieruſalem, that in the ſpirituall courſe God was
the Maſter, and therfore no man ought to make himſelf a Maſter to
another, iudging him and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to leade him the ſame way as he
himſelf is led by God, becauſe that way alſo is good wherin God directeth
others.</p>
               <p>To thoſe that asked him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile what they should doe, he
anſwered, they should loue God and their neighbours, becauſe that was the
high way for all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leaſt to the greateſt, and that herein one could
not doe amiſſe, becauſe it is our law wherin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth all
perfection.</p>
               <p>He was allſo wont to ſay, that to be allwaies talking of
ſpirit was milke and the temptation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, and that allthough one 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:5694:99"/>had an vnderſtanding like a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim, yet he ought nor
deſire to make it knowne without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>He eſteemed it better to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his neighbour vnto God
then to ſpeake of God, vnles there were ſome ſpeciall need. To thoſe
that had allready proſited in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, he ſaid: it is better to
ſpeake with God then of God.</p>
               <p>To one that eſteemed himſelf a ſpirituall man, he ſaid:
it would be a great shame vnto you, if it were knowne that you deſired to
liue in this world; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he alledged S. Paul, who ſaid: we
haue nor here any permanent city, but we ſeeke after that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to
continue; and he perſwaded himſelf that he that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after this manner
might be numbred amongſt the ſpirituall men.</p>
               <p>When he heard ſome great and miraculous thinges reported he
was vſed to ſay: I had rather haue <pb n="189" facs="tcp:5694:99"/>one degree of the
pure loue of God then all this noiſe.</p>
               <p>He was once asked, whether thoſe that were perfect had any
recreations, he anſwered, yes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when one goeth a iourney he loues
to ſee his horſe eate (for ſo he called his body) but he ſaid; the
perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen in his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, carieth a hand ouer his body quite
contrary to the vnperfect, who doe not vſe this mediocrity, for they ſuffer
their mind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to be ouer much vexed and troubled, at other times to be
led with, the delight of their nature.</p>
               <p>ALlthovgh in conuerſation it be an vſuall thing for men to
laughe at the careleſnes, ouerſights, or rash words of another, or when one
is vexed, or his foot ſlippeth, or he getteth a fall, or cometh in with
ſome notable blemish or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, yet he was neuer ſeen to laugh in
ſuch occaſions, but rather ſeemed to pitty them a new.</p>
               <p>When any afflicted perſon came <pb n="190" facs="tcp:5694:100"/>vnto him,
he shewed great feeling of his griefe, accommodated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him, and
diſmiſſed him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly comforted.</p>
               <p>There came vnto this village a noble and vertuous Lady much
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to viſit her, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d though I ſtaied a great while with her
to comfort her, yet I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile at all. Afterwardes she her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſpoke with Gregory, who had ſo great prudence or rather hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſpirit
in comforting her, as that she went our ſaying: I goe away ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>When his aduiſe was asked in things that were doubtfull and
hart to be reſolued, he anſwered: to morrow will come and we shall be
wiſer, giueing to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that a doubtfull thing was not to be
reſolned, without trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting firſt with God of it, not that he was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>be vnderſtood ſoe that by meanes of
his prayer he should preſently know and reſolue it, for that cannot be
imagined of ſuch <pb n="191" facs="tcp:5694:100"/>an humble man. By this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allſo (to morrow will come, and we shall be wiſer) he did meane the hower
of our death; for then the morning will come for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he knowing of doubts.</p>
               <p>The heauenly wiſedome, which he did shew in his deedes was
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable; he did heare Maſſe with ſuch ſilence, attention, and
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and receiued the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with ſuch profound
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, as that he ſtirred vp all men to deuotion. He would neuer
ſpeake to any body in the Church, but if he had vrgent buſines with any
one, he went out and ſpeedily diſpatched it.</p>

reaſon, each of thoſe things aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned doth not only shew great

God. Who would not eſteeme it valour, that a young man of ninteen yeares of
age, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch parts and natural gifts as we haue ſeen, should
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake parents, kindred, houſe, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the kings court. which he
had begun to follow, and with it ſuch great hopes of preferment, and goe two
thouſand leagues and more into exile, to liue in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſo full of
perills, amongſt the moſt ſauage, and barbarous men of new ſpaine. It
ſeemes very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this ſtrength was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by God, for in my
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it is exceeding great courage in ſuch a young man, to recollect
himſelf, and in ſuch manner to <pb n="193" facs="tcp:5694:101"/>conforme himſelf to
the will of God, as neuer to goe or ſay any thing that might be
diſpleaſing vnto him, and to endeauour with all his ſtrength, to blott

thing beſides God or that which was manifeſtly his pleaſure and glory.
Who could giue ſuch vertue beſides that moſt mighty hand? ſince that
this is a thing of ſuch difficulty as that to recollect ones ſelf inwardly
for a little while, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a vertuous man, it ſeemeth as if he were to goe

ſtrength was requiſit for ſo many yeares recollection, with ſuch

               <p>Whoſoeuer should know the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that Gregory did herin

and couragious he was, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially two things conſidered. The firſt is,
that ſince that heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo inflamed with charity to wardes his neighbours,
he was partaker of all their afflictions and griefes, and made them partakers
of his paines in praying for them He was tempted with all of them becauſe he

giue ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <pb n="197" facs="tcp:5694:103"/>delights to thoſe that walke in the

charges borne <pb n="198" facs="tcp:5694:104"/>in this life, and therfore he died ſo
well content that God led him by the way of the Croſſe. For all the many
murmurings which he heard againſt himſelf, ſome iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him an heretick,
others a foole, others a vagabound he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer excuſed nor anſwered for
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but defended and excuſed thoſe that ſpoke ill of him.</p>
               <p>Some of his freinds vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſion told him of a
great ſtirre that was raiſed againſt him, he anſwered them: God forbid
that I should trouble and diſtract my mind with thinking on it, and therwith
continued ſtill as quiet as he was before they told him of it.</p>
               <p>A certaine man of great account deſired me to informe him of
the eſtate of the Hoſpitall of Guaſteca, and after I had giuen him
account of all things, I told him that there was a man there called Gregory
Lopes, of ſuch and ſuch vertues, ſpirit; and prayer; and what doth 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:5694:104"/>this man, ſaid he, in the Hoſpitall? I anſwered,
that he was there all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a chamber at his prayers, and neuer went forth;
then he ſaid: to this man could I willingly giue two hundred ſtripes; and
when we told this ſtory afterwardes to Gregory, he ſmiling excuſed him,
ſaying: he ſaith well for an idle fellow doth well deſerue two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſtripes, and gentlemen that are full of buſines, cannot eaſily
vnderſtand what inward exerciſes are.</p>
               <p>It was neuer perceiued, that he had any deſire to be
eſteemed or knowne, and he hath often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended me for prayſing him, he
neuer cared for the viſits of the Viceroies, Prelates, and nobility, but
rather shewed, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was, withall modeſty and good reſpect, that
he did not take any content in thoſe viſites when they did not concerne the
glory of God or his neighbour his good; and though the holy man did 
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:5694:105"/>much eſteeme the great piety and wiſedome of Don Luys
de Velaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the Viceroy, yet he
intreated him to excuſe his viſits, alleadging good reaſons for his
requeſt. In thoſe viſites, that great perſons made vnto him he did
allwaies shew an humble grauity, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured token of his great mind.</p>
               <p>The Inquiſitours gaue order that his booke, which he made vpon
the Apocalips, should be ſeen and peruſed by Don Fray Pedro de Auguſto
Bishop of Cibu, who gaue in approbation, that he had neuer ſeen a better
expoſition of thoſe diuine reuelations; that he admired how he could ſay
ſo much, with ſuch certainty and shortnes; that he did beleeue he had
ſupernaturall light giuen him for the writing of that booke: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Inquiſition medled with that buſines, Gregory did not shew (nor doe we
think he had) any trouble of mind nether would he keepe a copy of it nor
ſpeake a <pb n="201" facs="tcp:5694:105"/>word of it, euen as if it had bin none of his
worke.</p>
               <p>Such was his greatnes of mind, as that he neuer acquainted any
man with his griefes and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor ſought comfort from any creature,
yet he was wont to tell, for the good of his neighbour, things that had hapned
vnto him in times paſt.</p>
               <p>Many times in they eare, he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure great paines of the
ſtomack and of the collick, yet he neuer complayned, nor changed
counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor the good poſture, that he was vſed to keep, when he was
in beſt health, ſo as I did not know his infirmities, but only by his great
weaknes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d extraordinary ill ſtomack. One time ſeing him much falne away,
I asked him: what aile you that you are ſo weake? He replyed 15. daies
together I haue bin troubled with à fit of the collick; and by theſe
meanes I came to know his diſeaſes which were ſo great, as that they made
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:5694:106"/>me pitty him and wonder how he could exerciſe ſuch
conſtancy and auſterity of life with them.</p>
               <p>He was ordinarily ſick of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which he cured by diet,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during hanger, if need were, for three, or foure, or fiue naturall daies, he
neuer vſed bed euen in his great ſickneſſes.</p>
               <p>whilſt he was in Santafe, he had the toothache for a yeare
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I had neuer knowne it, but that he went twice into the field for
hearbes, that he knew were good to cure him; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he could not eate
for paine. Hauing once hurt one of his great teeth, he would not let me ſend
for a barber to pull it out, but pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it out himſelf by a very paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes; ſuch was the deſire that he allwaies had of finding ſome
occaſion to ſuffer; for men that are vnited to God, vſe to find as much
content in ſuffering, as others find commonly in their ioy and eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:5694:106"/>This valiant man told me, that the diuell
did once aſſaile him in a viſible shape; and I askeing him how he did
defend himſelf, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me in theſe wordes: I thought that I could
not doe a better thing then that which I did, ſo I continued it with all my
ſtrength, and he vanished away and neuer tempted me viſiblily againe.</p>
               <p>We neuer heard him ſpeake any good ſentence, which he did
not put in practice when need was; and he was wont to ſay to this purpoſe:
miſery it ſelf is not to be, deſired, but a will to endure it with
moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind; and ſo he endured all theſe that hapened vnto him with
ſuch an inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſtant mind, as that he did not ſeeme ſubiect
to change; therfore from the firſt day that I ſaw him (which is 18. yeares
agoe) I preſently perceiued in him a certaine excellence which I had not
ſeene in any other man. This <pb n="204" facs="tcp:5694:107"/>opinion increaſed in me
euen till his death, and allſo ſince his death it increaſeth with the
wonders, which God doth daiely worke by him.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the intent of this Chapter, what courage and
valour might a ſouldier haue, who from a poore country fellow should come by
feates of armes to be a Grandy of the king his court? but how much greater
valour is neceſſary for a ſpirituall ſouldier, of himſelf poore and
abiect, a ſon of Adam, to become great in the court, of God, and ſince that
Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory is come to that height of honour as to be great in the court of
heauen, it is fitting that his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and courage should be knowne, that ſo
we may glorify God in this Sainte, gathering by that little which is written
here, the great aboundance that God hath beſtowed on him, in compariſon of
which this that is written is nothing; partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:5694:107"/>of the care which he vſed in concealing his vertues,
partly for feare leaſt I should exceed the breuity which I had intended in
this relation, telling only thoſe that were ſo open to the view, as that
they could not but be ſeene.</p>
               <p>I asked him one day how he could ſo much conceale his
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, it ſeeming vnto me an heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and hard thing to doe, he
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me that ſentence worthy of eternall memory: To conceale ones
vertues is not a thing hard vnto him that hath a liuely faith, for if a man doe
certainly beleeue, that all his vertues shall be ſeen in the court of heauen,
what will he care, whether they be knowne or no in the village of this
world.</p>

Gregory Lopes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I should haue bene very happy, if God had giuen me any part of
the great inward pouerty, which he beſtowed on this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, the which
conſiſteth in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the heart free from all loue of creatures, and giuing
himſelf wholy to the loue of his Creatour, for it may be ſayd of this holy
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue peculiarly, that thoſe that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it can ſpeake better of it
then thoſe that ſtudy it, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I should better declare
Gregory his vertues if I had ſome of it. What an excellent patterne of it
this Sainct hath bin may partly be vnderſtood by that which I ſaw with my
owne eies, and by what I gathered by the auſwers he gaue to many men in
diuerſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:5694:108"/>The ſons of Adam, haue for the moſt
part ingrafted in them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be eſteemed more excellent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>their
neighbours. Gregory was ſo free from this that he allwaies preferred others
before himſelf, and to that purpoſe I haue often heard him ſay: ſince I
begun to liue ſolitary I neuer iudged any body, I eſteemed all men better
and wiſer then myſelf, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe I were asked, I neuer gaue
counſaile to any man, nor made myſelf a teather of others. Of this all that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſed with him are witneſſes, and we haue ſeene by experience, that
becauſe he would not make himſelf a Maſter to any, God hath ordained that
he should be vnto many. From hence proceeded the great care that he allwaies
had to excuſe thoſe that did iudge him; and as I told him one day that
there were many that slaundered him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: I haue allwaies excuſed
them not only in wordes, but allſo <pb n="208" facs="tcp:5694:109"/>with all my heart in
deedes. From hence allſo it came to paſſe, that he did not deſire his
ſpeeches should be valued, and therfore he neuer went about to premeditate
and compoſe the wordes, that he was to ſpeake, before hand; and he told me
to this purpoſe, that once (it was before he began his ſolitary life) he
ſpent ſome time before hand in thinking of the diſcourſe that he was to
make, and that afterwardes he had no occaſion to ſpeake it, wherby he was
aduertiſed not to looſe time in compoſeing his wordes, truſting in God
that he would giue him thoſe that were conuenient when need was, and for this
cauſe God gaue him the grace neuer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any errour in his ſpeech, for
all the wordes that he ſpoke ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med full of diuine wiſedome; the Lord of
heauen and earth reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto this humble ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoſe thinges, which
he hath hidden <pb n="209" facs="tcp:5694:109"/>from the prudent and wiſe of the
world.</p>
               <p>Eight daies before his death there came to viſite him a
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man very wiſe and vertuous, and his great freind, and among other
thinges that he talked of, ſeing his life in danger he asked him very
familiarly: muſt we goe now to enioy God? thinking that he would tell him of
the hower of his death; but this humble ſeruant of God anſwered him with
great admiration: Doth your reuerence aske me this? it shall be as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God; as if he should ſay: you that are wiſe, doe you thinke that I know the
hower of my death? I doe not deſerue ſo much; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the religious man
was much edified.</p>
               <p>Three or foure daies before his death, there came in to ſee
him an Indian woman of this village, and as I was ſpeaking to her in her owne
tongue, becauſe he did not vnderſtand it, he ſaid vnto me, 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:5694:110"/>note well what she ſaith, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture she will giue
me ſome good aduice; wherin I noted his great humility, ſince that he
thought himſelf of leſſe worth then an Indian woman, and that she could
tell him what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for him now in the end of his life.</p>
               <p>More ouer men are wont to haue another affection, that is, to
thinke of what is to befall them, from which Gregory was very free, for he that
deſireth purely to ſerue God, eſteemeth all ſuch cares as lets and
hindrances; and therfore he neuer thought of courſes of changing his life
what should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him whether he should dy of hunger or cold; or should be
bedrid, whether he should liuelo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g or a little while, whether he should doe
ſuch or ſuch thinges for the ſeruice of God or his neigbours good;
becauſe he knew there was wont to be in thes and the like thoughts, if one
were caried away <pb n="211" facs="tcp:5694:110"/>with them, ſome ſecret tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the enemie, or at the leaſt loſſe of time, and for this reaſon, like
a wary and humble man, vpon occaſion of ſuch thoughts he allwaies ſaid; I
am nothing, I am good for nothing; contenting himſelf with doing that which
God in his holy law commandeth him, and not iudging himſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of other
thinges in times to come, though he was alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in mind to doe
whatſoeuer the diuine Maieſtie, did ordaine.</p>
               <p>One time, as ſome were talking in his preſence of the
ſumptuous tombes that ſome men build, and of their competences about places
and chappells, he ſaid: when I dy let them bury my body where they will, ſo
it be in holy ground, but if they doe not, it will ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy them as that it
will make them quickly enterre it.</p>
               <p>He was ſo far from taking care and prouiding for himſelf for
the time to come, as that he would <pb n="212" facs="tcp:5694:111"/>not ſuffer that any
body elſe should take care for him; for when I went about to looke for
another place to liue in, becauſe the aire of this village of Santafe was not
very commodious for his weaknes and ſicknes, he allwaies ſaid vnto me: let
no man be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for me, for God will haue a care to prouide as shall
pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>He had his heart allſo free from all curious affection, both
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall, into which ſome contemplatiues vſe to fall,
ſo he told me ſometimes, that ſince his choice of ſolitary life he had
neuer deſired to ſee any thing of the world, euen not his parents, country,
or friends, &amp;c. Neither did he deſire to ſee the Angells, nor haue
extaſies, nor reuelations, for he ſaid that he only deſired to ſee God,
yet allwaies with this reſignation, that it should be when and how it
pleaſed God; and that the rapts, and extaſies <pb n="213" facs="tcp:5694:111"/>that he
deſired in this life, was to conforme himſelf euery day more and more with
the will of God, and fullfill it in all occaſions with all certainty and
truth.</p>
               <p>We perceiued in this holy man a thing worthy of conſideration,
which was, that he neuer reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for any temporall thing, nor gaue it
entrance into his mind. His ioye was God, and his delight and glory was to doe
his holy will, and benefit his neighbour. Vpon a certaine occaſion I told him
that I did greatly eſteeme that vertue; he ſaid vnto me: it is a shame for
vs that liue in the law of grace, and haue wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced the world to
eſteeme this, ſince Queene Eſter being wife to a great Monarch, ſaid:
Thou knoweſt well my Lord and God, that ſince I was brought to this
pallace, vntill this preſent day, thy handmaid hath not ioyed but only in
thee.</p>
               <p>From the firſt time that I viſited <pb n="214" facs="tcp:5694:112"/>him

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat if it was neceſſary to doe
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething for him, neuer ſo hard, I should not haue ſtuck vpon it. So I
aſſiſted him in whatſoeuer he had need of, viſiting him
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſoeuer he was, and becauſe he was in Guaſteca, I asked almes three
yeares together for the poore of that hoſpitall, a thing which was to me in
thoſe times, more then any one can imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: and to ſay all in a word,
from the time that I knew him, vntill he died in my company, which were
eighteen yeares, methought I could haue bin content to haue bin his slaue, and
he knew it very well and shewed himſelf very gratefull; yet I dare affirme,
that neuer any one ſaw him rely or put the leaſt hope in that which I did
or could doe, nor that he ſet his affection vpon me in any exceſſiue
manner for all whatſoeuer I did. <pb n="215" facs="tcp:5694:112"/>For in all the good
turnes that he receiued, he allwaies beheld God as the authour of them, and the
creature as the meanes, wherby the diuine godnes and prouidence did ſend
them: ſo as his gratitude towardes his benefactours was in God not in
himſelf, beſeeching earneſtly his diuine Maieſty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite that good
worke, that was done vnto him, ſince that he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their wills to doe
it.</p>
               <p>In like manner he endeauoured that for any good worke of his
towards his neighbour, the tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes should not be giuen to him, but only to God,
as we did often ſee, that when ſome went to aske him doubts, he did not
anſwer them but praied vnto God to tell it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to themſelues, that
the thankes for that knowledge might be giuen vnto God, and not vnto him,
neither whole nor in part.</p>

Lopes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SInce the time that he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wildernes, and offered
himſelf vp wholly vnto God, he neuer poſſeſſed any thing of his owne.
To this purpoſe he was wont to ſay, that when one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth delight in
outward pouerty, it is a ſigne that he is inwardly rich.</p>
               <p>This great loue of pouerty made him deuiſe ſundry and
admirable meanes, wherby to excell in it. Wherfore as for the firſt, he would
not vſe any certaine kind of attire; but in diuers times he wore
ſuchap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell as God did ſend him; for in the firſt eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares it was
courſe ſack cloath, afterwardes in Atriſco his hoſt gaue him ſome
gray cloath to couer himſelf and that was the beſt garment he wore in 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:5694:113"/>all his life.</p>
               <p>The bare ground was his bed whileſt he could paſſe with it
without endamaging his health; afterwardes he did ly vpon ſome shepskins,
vntill his great fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes and diſeaſes forced him to take a little quilt
very thin and a couerlet: this was his beſt bed, and he accepted of it at my
impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, as is allready ſaid.</p>
               <p>His chamber was very poore; for he would neuer accept of
han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, or other furniture were it neuer ſo meane, euen when he was very
weake and ſickly.</p>
               <p>He washed his cloaths himſelf, partly becauſe he was very
cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as allſo becauſe of his indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; at ſome times in
the yeare he washed his feet, and he himſelf warmed the water in the ſunne,
he neuer let any body wash them for him, neither doe I know that euer anie one
ſaw his bare skin.</p>
               <p>He was ſo temperate in his diet, that he neuer did himſelf
harme <pb n="218" facs="tcp:5694:114"/>by eating, either fruit, though he loued it very
well, or any other meate, but onely once by eating of greene hearbes and wild
quinces. To this purpoſe he was wont to ſay that poore men ought to looke
well to their health, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in eating or drinking, leaſt they
should be burthenſome to their neighbours.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his ſolitary life he eate no flesh,
afterwardes when he conuerſed more with men, he eate of that which was ſet
before him, but he neuer eate but one meale a day.</p>
               <p>His moueables were only a bible, a map and a globe, which, as is
ſaid, he made with his owne handes, and two other bookes that he had
wriren.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his pouerty, it was the will of God that he
should neuer aske any almes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by wordes, deedes, nor ſignes, nor euen
by making shew of a good life, the which is wont <pb n="219" facs="tcp:5694:114"/>without
wordes to moue men to giue almes; becauſe the diuine Maieſty would haue him
liue in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner to let vs ſee by aſſiſting him ſo punctually in
all his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, that his diuine Prouidence neuer faileth; and if for
ſome time he did permit him to endure want of neceſſaries, it was to the
end that his merits increaſing his rewardes allſo might increaſe. How
often in trauailing hath he come weary to his lodging? and ſtaied there
without eating any thing? at night laid himſelf downe vpon the bare ground,
and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning trauailed ſome leagues on foot? for ſo he was
vſed to doe, there being no body that tooke any care to ſupply his want and
pouerty; and I doe not meruaile much, for Gregory by his countenance ſeemed
rather a Lord then a poore man, though oftentimes he endured extreame hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,
thirſt, wearines, toile a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour into which God brought him 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:5694:115"/>in diuerſe occaſions. I know well that this is much,
but yet his ſtrength and valour was ſuch, as that allthough God had brought
him into more and far greater wants, he would not haue shrunke from his
purpoſe of obſeruing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, for he had purpoſed not to aske any thing,
hoping that God would relieue him as he allwaies did.</p>
               <p>Perceiuing how much ſometimes he was in commodated whileſt
he was in my houſe, by not asking any thing, one day I ſaid vnto him: if I
ſaw my ſelf in neceſſity, I would aske almes to shame and humble my
ſelf, he anſwered me: But not I. Then I replied: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes I should doe
ill in not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which I had need of; to this he ſaid: for you, you
ſay well, and this is a good courſe, but not for me; for God directeth
euery one in his proper way.</p>
               <p>In his latter yeares he was vſed to drinke a little wine in
the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <pb n="221" facs="tcp:5694:115"/>for if he did not take it, he was much
tormented with the paine of the collick, and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack; and though I had
allwaies a care to giue it him, yet I could not allwaies come to know when he
had ſpent it. One day ſeing him very weake and pale, I asked him what he
ailed? he anſwered: I haue not taken a draught of wine this morning, and
therfore I haue bin in great paine. I began to be troubled, becauſe I had no
wine in the houſe to giue him; but God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him very punctually,
for euen at that inſtant there came a friend of mine, and brought vs a little
good wine.</p>
               <p>He was ſo conſtant in not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any thing, as that once I
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him making a web of threed of a little clout, and asking him what he made
that for, he told me that it was to ſow with, and though he knew that I had
thread, he did not aske any.</p>
               <p>Seauenteen yeares and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="222" facs="tcp:5694:116"/>his
death, I had a deſire to giue him all that he had need of, aſſuring my
ſelf that it was the will of God that I should doe ſo: and though I had
made knowne vnto him this my deſire, he neuer as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked any thing of me; at
length perceiuing by ſo many experiences the way wherin God did direct him, I
did vſe from time to time to lay before him ſome thinges, that I thought he
might haue vſe of, and he did take what he had need of.</p>
               <p>There was another thing in his pouerty very admirable, that is,
it ſeemes that God would haue this his ſeruant eate of other mens
lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, like a true poore man, for I haue often obſerued, that
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was dreſſed purpoſely for him, did him harme. Of this I
haue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g experience, for ſeing him ſo weake and feeble, I cauſed ſome
dainties to be made for him, and as ſoone as he eate them they did him harme,
and he himſelf intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="223" facs="tcp:5694:116"/>me to make nothing for his
owne perſon, but I, imputing this to his deſire of not being
trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and allſo of liuing like a poore man, did againe cauſe
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be made ready of purpoſe for him, and it ſo fell out, that
by the harme he felt in eating of thoſe thinges, he came to know that they
had bin made for him, and then he declared himſelf, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me plainely that
he would not haue any thing made peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him.</p>
               <p>And ſo I haue perceiued that if cloath, or linnen, or any
other thing was bought for him it did him harme, though on the other ſide our
Lord did bring him into ſuch neceſſity, by infirmities, and weaknes, as
that it ſeemed a thing impoſſible to be able to endure that which he did,
and when in this laſt ſicknes there was need of particular things, he
forbad me to cauſe them to be made for him: but if any ſent them out of
chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <pb n="224" facs="tcp:5694:117"/>I should take them, in good time; yea perhapes
his death was haſtned by ſome thinges that were made ready for him, which

thought neceſſary, for which cauſe the holy man held his peace at that
time, and receiued them with patience.</p>
               <p>It ſeemes that God was his ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and would not let him
in this life ſpend any thing of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patrimony, and ſeing that

re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of dishoneſt thinges which the diuell repreſented vnto
him very liuely, and with a worſe and more alluring impreſſion then the
reall thinges themſelues could make, and though God gaue him the grace to
tread all this vnder foote, yet he could not but feele great paine and
ſorrow, ſeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hanging only by the ſlender haire of his owne
will, wherwith he was in danger to conſent, and eſpecially, becauſe at

with more heed and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines in the narrow path of vertue.</p>
               <p>What paines might Gregory ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his enemies were not tired either day or night with figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:5694:119"/>nor fled were they found reſiſtance, nor were ashamed
where they found vertue? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince that they not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed
him without, but were allſo within him, prouoking him to euill, and
oppoſing him in goodnes. Neuertheleſſe theſe paines ſo great and ſo
dreadfull were delights and contentments vnto Gregory, who endured them for the
glory of his God. In like manner he behaued himſelf in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the battery
of reaſons which the enemy brought againſt our holy Catholick faith; the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, ſnares, intanglings, doubts, which vpon this ſuhiect
he did raiſe; for faith being the ground of ſpirituall life, the
temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt it is a torment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the diuell himſelf.
Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory ſuffered this conſtantly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtrong in his faith, and
with his profound humility made his aduerſaries inſtantly wanish away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:5694:120"/>The ſouldiers of our Lord are allſo
wont in the like recollection to be tempted with the ſpirit of blaſphemie,
yet he that knoweth how to fly ſpiritually, and hath found delight in the
loue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d praiſes of God, with ſuch excellence as Gregory did, returneth
allwaies conquerour from this fight, and getteth life by the hand of his
enemy.</p>
               <p>In the ſpirituall life, men are not a little nor ſeldome
mortified and afflicted with a kind of ſwouning, wherby the diuell ſeeketh
to ſtop their way; for the ſoule deſiring to pleaſe God and walke in
his waies, findeth ſometimes in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch a kind of remiſſenes
and weakennes, as that it ſeemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her a thing impoſſible to goe a
ſtep farther, and knowing, that if she doth not goe forwardes, she
diſpleaſeth God; and that to pleaſe him she muſt goe on merrily, great
is the paine she feeleth in percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing herſelf ſo vnable to follow 
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:5694:120"/>that which God would haue her. God gaue vnto this his
ſeruant the valour and courage that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the ſuffering of
theſe thinges with patience and profit, and for the gaining of the victory,
ſtrengthening him in theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with humility and knowledg of
himſelf by which he might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all the good that he; should doe
afterwardes, to the diuine goodnes as the fountaine of all good.</p>
               <p>Perfect men ſuffer allſo other kindes of paines wherwith
they are much moleſted and afflicted; for haueing allready attained to an
excellent degree of charity, they grieue at oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r mens euills as if they were their owne: it cannot be
expreſſed in few wordes in what continuall griefe and affliction our
Gregory did liue, ſeing the blindnes of ſinners, the obſtinacy of
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, the many ſoules that euery day are damned, for this is that
wherof we ought truely to haue a <pb n="232" facs="tcp:5694:121"/>feeling, though he did
allſo feele the ſickneſſes, hunger, iniuries, warres, and the other
grieuances of his neighbours, as if he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them himſelf.</p>
               <p>Another combate of the diuell is, to repreſent vnto thoſe
that aſpire to perfection, eſpecially at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, how that all the
world will riſe againſt them, as it hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen vp againſt all the
followers of vertue, and how they shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by falſe
witneſſes in infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, and ſuch, as they doe moſt abhorre; and
that if they had profited any thing by their good life and example, all this
would turne to ſcandall and a ſtumbling block for other; and though vnto
ſome theſe burthens ſeeme but light, yet the truth is, that when God
giueth our aduerſary leaue to ſtraighten theſe cordes, he maketh the
ſeruants of God ſweate for a long time; for this is a farre more hard and
auſtere penance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of the body, though they ſeeme to 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:5694:121"/>vs to ſit like idle and loitering me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The truth hereof
God hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, plainly in Gregory Lopes, not only in his moderation of mind
and patience which he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue him in ſuch cumbates and
aduerſities, but allſo by the wonders that he hath wrought by him, and in
him.</p>
               <p>I will here note one thing, which for its rarity did much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
me. I obſerued diligently for many yeares, that this admirable man neuer made
a ſtand in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall courſe: and though I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſidered
that his being continually in the loue of God cauſed in him that great
perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet I neuer reſted alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfied, vntill that as
I was thinking of it, it pleaſed God to open my eies, and let me know that
this his conſtancy did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall loue of God, and his
neighbour for God his ſake: therupon I ſaid once vnto <pb n="234" facs="tcp:5694:122"/>him: cannot you take any reſt in the ſpirituall courſe? he
anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me with a peaceable and chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull countenance: I neither doe nor
can take any reſt, as long as my brethren are amongſt ſo many dangers and
troubles: for it is not fitting that I should retire my ſelf, where I may be
ſafe, leauing them on the bulls hornes; I will not doe ſuch an vnworthy
thing, if I know of one only that is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I will not take any reſt all
my life time. That which I more admire at, is that he neuer looked vpon thoſe
contentments, which God is wont liberally, to beſtow in the ſpirituall
life, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the progreſſe which men had made, nor that he
neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created himſelf with the memory of his dangers a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d troubles paſt,
nor wiht the vertues which by Gods help he had purchaſed; for vertues after
they are gotten cauſe ioyand peace. The reaſon why he did not ioyin this,
was becauſe, he alwaies <pb n="235" facs="tcp:5694:122"/>fixed his eies, not vpon that
which he had but that which he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither would he ſtay by the wayes to
reſt himſelf, for God would haue him allwaies make more progreſſes, and
afcend very craggy hills, for he told me once that in thoſe three firſt
yeares in which he exereiſed himſelf in the reſignation aboue mentioned,
God had made him climbe vp great hills.</p>
               <p>He endured another painefull and troubleſome mortification in
two, as I may call them, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which God gaue him in this life. The one
was of loue, the which as I perceiued, he had, when he did liue at
Guaſteca.</p>
               <p>The paine that it bringeth with it, thoſe that haue made
triall know to be moſt grieuous, and thoſe that haue not come ſo far,
will not beleeue it. For by the light which God infuſeth into the higher part
of the ſoule, the heart is ſo wounded with loue, as the 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:5694:123"/>ſweetnes is vnſpeakable, and the griefe ſuch, as
cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the ſoule fainteth, becauſe she cannot obtaine
that which aboue all other she deſireth; There gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in her an ardent, but
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable impatience, dureing which it hath no quietnes, reſt, nor eaſe.
In this eſtate God doth ſometimes inſpire admirable wordes, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
meanes and documents of true wiſedome the ſoule indureth an incredible
paine, both in paſſing through the tourments which she doth ſuffer, and
the ioyes and inſpirations which God impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto her: and ſo I did
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in this holy man a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mortification, for he did endure
this purgatory of loue with ſuch ſilence as if he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a
ſpirituall wearines.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Pargatory is deſire: here with the ſoule is
tormented, when she ſeeth that she cannot in this life attaine to her
chiefeſt good, wherof she hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <pb n="237" facs="tcp:5694:123"/>this brought
vnto Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much griefe and trouble, for as he with his quick
vnderſtanding, liuely faith, and purity of ſpirit meditated and
contemplated the greatnes of God, he became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſo great and amarous
a knowledge of that ſame great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that, he had a moſt ardent deſire to
goe and poſſeſſe it; and as he did perceiue that in this life, in
running after the odour of thoſe diuine ointments, he could neuer obtaine the
good he ſo much deſired, he reſted wounded and grieued, like the Hart
that thirſteth for the ſprings of ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning water to quench his thirſt, and
cannot come to them; but of this, becauſe it belongeth to few, we haue ſaid
enough.</p>
               <p>But that wherin Gregory mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified himſelf all the time of his
life, and wherin he ſuffered moſt, was as he told me, in following
allwaies, as he did, the grace of God; for it is certaine that one 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:5694:124"/>cannot follow grace, vnleſſe he fly from nature: what
paine then and mortification would it be to a ſeruant of God to goe on
all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies flying from, and denying himſelf? for many times grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
of vs that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to natures deſire, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is
neceſſary that one dye, that the other may liue. Therfore, that grace might
liue, Gregory endeauoured to be dead to all creatures; becauſe it is the
proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature to liue to them, and becauſe she deſireth eſteeme and
honour for her good workes and not to be deſpiſed of any, therfore he
ſought to hide his good deedes and vertues, and to be deſpiſed by the
world, as our Sauour was, and following grace, ſtudied how to lay aſide all
care of temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and bent himſelf only to ſeeke out and ſerue
God, ſince nature inclineth to the contrary; and becauſe she is puffed vp
with proſperity and deiected with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:5694:124"/>Gregory
by grace was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receiue with moderation of mind, and conſtancy,
what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſoeuer, without ſeekeing the interiour content of
thoſe or other vertues for himſelf, but only reioycing for the glory that
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by redoundeth vnto God. Nature as it were forgetting this, doth in all
thinges ſeeke her owne conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and deſireth all the good for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
all her language is, I, and, for me she hateth her euemy, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at another
mans harme and repineth at his good. Whoſoeuer shall haue read this booke, or

he was earneſtly intreated. When he came to Santafe, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of Mexico
before day, without euer looking vpon the ſtreets or buildings. Whileſt he
was in this village, he was importuned to goe downe and ſee a garden
belonging to the ſame houſe that he dwelt in, where was good ſtore of
water, green graſſe, and flowers, yet he neuer did in ſix yeares time,
onely one yeare he went downe for a little water to drinke. He did looke vpon
mens bodies with an honeſt freedome a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d free honeſty, as if they had bin
ſoules without bodies, or bodies without life and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Though it be a thing ſo naturall, eſpecially to men of a
good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to be delighted with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, yet in all the time that
I knew him, I neuer ſaw him goe to heare any, though ſometimes it hapned to

                  </gap>s,
and oftentimes he told me, that if the muſick of the great 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:5694:127"/>Church of Toledo or all that is in the world, were but
one pace off of him, he would not goe to heare it, but if perchance he were
preſent where it was, he did heare it quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and got ſpirit out of
it.</p>
               <p>All ill ſmells were very offenſiue vnto him, yet he would
neuer vſe any ſweet ſmells; many noſegaies were offered him, but he for
the moſt part refuſed them, ſome he did take, leaſt by doing
otherwiſe, he should diſcontent him that brought them. Sometimes, though
but ſeldome, he would take a white lilly or red roſe, becauſe, as he
ſaid, the ſmell of thoſe flowers is very chaſt.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as he went into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, he made a purpoſe
neuer to eate with intent to pleaſe his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but only to ſuſtaine his
life, the which he obſerued all his life, in ſo much as that when I
perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to taſt of a Melon, grapes, or figgs (for thoſe fruits are

               <p>Allthough he loued fruit very well and deſired to liue vpon
it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he ſaid, it was the proper food of man: for in Paradiſe

allready ſaid, he told me that fruit neuer did him harme, and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

moderately.</p>
               <p>That which he did eate of with a good appetite, was bread the
ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the poore, but it ſeemeth, he obtained of God to find,
euen in that, ſuch mortification and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, as that ſome yeares
before his death, he could not eate one
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſpices in it, and that was his diet at this time, making way for the bread
with ſome light meate. Sometimes he chanced to keep his bread in his mouth a
good while, and I bidding him remember to ſwallow it, he ſaid: I cannot,
and that one of the painfulleſt thinges to him was to eate; neuertheles he
made much account of his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſes, knowing of what profit they are to a ſpitituall man, if
he keep them well mortified.</p>
               <p>After a burning feauer which he had, there remained a lingering
ague, which held him allmoſt a yeare, and in this neceſſity I often
importuned him to vſe ſome shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but I could neuer perſwade him to
it.</p>
               <p>I neither can nor ought to paſſe ouer in ſilence, a very
ſubtile mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I perceiued in Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory: for the vnderſtanding
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is to be noted, that one of the thinges wherwith nature is moſt 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:5694:128"/>mortified, is, that the ſpirit doth not cherish her nor
giue her any part of that which paſſeth in its ſelf, debarring her of the
part she was to haue in the ſpirituall worke. This premiſed: I haue
obſerued for many yeares (which we haue ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both together, liuing in the
ſame houſe, eating at the ſame table, and ſleeping in the ſame
chamber) that he did neuer weep, nor ſigh, nor lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his handes, nor
shrunke vp his ſoulders, nor ſpoke any word aloud with God nor to
himſelf, by which one might come to know his inward affections, a thing which
in a man of ſo great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſpirit would amayſe any one that knew
what belonged to prayer and contemplation. I admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring much here at ſaid one
day vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: you being thus allwaies vnited vnto God, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of ſuch a Lord, doe neither ſigh, nor ſpeake, but are alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rapt
in extaſy with the diuine goodnes; wherunto he anſwered: 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:5694:129"/>That is not the reaſon, Father Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, for truly I doe
ſigh and grone allmoſt a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d times in the day, and am allmoſt
allwaies talking with God though only mentally: I haue vſed this manner now
thirty yeares, and I endeauour not to giue nature any of theſe feelings
(which is to her no ſmall mortification) becauſe I haue found her falſe
and treatcherous.</p>
               <p>I became not ſo perfect in this leſſon; but that
ſometimes going into the garden to prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, I should forget
my ſelf, knocking ſometimes my breſt or ſighing, and Gregory hearing me
would in a pleaſant ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner ſay vnto me: Father Loſa, giue Nature now and
then a bit, leaſt she dy for hunger: but he did not giue ſuch counſailes
to other men, but rather aduiſed them to help themſelues with thoſe
outward ſignes, for without them they did not any thing. I am verily
perſwaded, that he that shall read with a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <pb n="249" facs="tcp:5694:129"/>eie the pennance and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications which are here related, will
reſt fully ſatisfied that this heroicall man went not into the wildernes to
ſleep and be idle, but to doe and ſuffer. I am allſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that if
he would haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old other greater
mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which he endured, a courſe of ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and vertue
would haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in vs great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it would haue allſo bin much
better, if thoſe thinges had bin better expounded, that they might be better
knowne, for I confeſſe that I haue left out many thinges, becauſe I could
not explicate them and make them vnderſtood, yet by thoſe that we haue
ſet downe, one may perceiue that his life was all mortification, penance and
croſſes.</p>
               <p>Now it remaineth for vs to ſee the profits, that Gregory
reaped by this vertue. Firſt ſuch ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that, as he was wont
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o tell me; he now ouercame with
Gods grace all temptations with a blaſt; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="250" facs="tcp:5694:130"/>ſuch a dexterity in ſighting, as that his enimies as puiſſant
as they were, could neuer make him giue back one ſtep, but that he went
allwaies getting ground, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a firme confidence in God, as that
if he had a whole ſquadron of temptations againſt him, he should ouercome
and put them all to flight; and ſo, though ueuer ſo many bid him battell,
he neuer left of the exerciſe that God had giuen him; but euen in the
middeſt of them walked on in the loue of God and his neighbour. Thirdly
ſuch a peace and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelf in his manner of combate, as that
neuer any could perceiue, whether he was inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in combate, or at peace.</p>
               <p>He was allwaies the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change, and in him was
verified that ſentence: the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſtable like the ſun, but the
foole hath his changes like the moone; and he was vſed ſometimes to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate it. Fourthly by this his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, <pb n="251" facs="tcp:5694:130"/>he
obtained of God, as one allready well exerciſed, to be made the elder
brother, being now able to haue a care of his brethren and neighbours, to fight
for them: and that his combates, which he fought for his neighbours ſake,
should be accepred of as if they had fought themſelues, as I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it
often hapned, as shall be ſaid in the 19. Chapter of the effects of his
prayers. All this his ſtrength proceeded from the liuely faith which he had
in God, wherby he vnderſtood clearely and diſtinctly, the greatnes of the
diuine goodnes and mercy, which ſufferreth not any to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted aboue his
ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, therfore he fought his combates with delight, ſaying with
ſpirituall contentment, that this was neuer wanting vnto him; and he was wont
to ſay that whoſoeuer had receiued that delight from God was allready, as
is ſaid out of his ſwadling clouts.</p>

allwaies vſed prayer. He told me that when he was a little page in the court,
he vſed mentall prayer, and went <pb n="253" facs="tcp:5694:131"/>vpon errands with as
much quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mind, as he had ſix yeares before his death; and that he
did not looſe this quietnes, though there paſſed by Dukes and Earles, and
other thinges hapned that vſe to be in the court, and that he perſeuered in
his prayer amongſt thoſe noiſes as well, as if he had bin alone in a
mountaine, though afterwardes he went on, allwaies by exerciſe perfecting
both his prayer and quietnes. If therfore at twelue yeares of age he had
attained to ſuch peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in prayer, it is to be thought that he
began to pray, ſome yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res before he came to this degree and perfection; and
if thes yeares from the time that he had the vſe of reaſon, vntill he went
into the wildernes were but few, we may well thinke that he ſpent them in the
exerciſe of prayer, eſpecially of it be true, as we vnderſtand it is,
that before he came to the court to be a page, he was in Nauarre 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:5694:132"/>ſix yeares with an hermit, as is ſaid in the
beginning of this booke.</p>
               <p>The ſame might be gathered by the courage which God gaue him
whileſt he was in the court, for allthough he was two or three yeares in that
place, in which are ſo many hindrances for thoſe that walke in the paths of
God, he had ſtrength enough to paſſe through them all without altering
his good purpoſe, but ſuch valour and courage is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome got without
long exerciſe in conuerſation with God. Beſides he was but twenty yeares
old when he came to new ſpaine, and yet he came ſo well profited in mentall
prayer, that he not only endeauoured to vſe it much at a time but did
allwaies continue in it, whether he were trauailing, writing or talking; and he
told me that for his better attaining vnto it, as ſoone as he came to Mexico,
he faſted a whole lent with bread <pb n="255" facs="tcp:5694:132"/>and water in the
houſe of Luys Zapata, with intention to beg of God his fauour and
aſſiſtance, and to employ him in ſome place, where he might beſt
ſerue him, and giue himſelf vp wholly to his diuine Maieſty. It is cleare
that ſuch progreſſe in vertue is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily got ſo ſodainly, but
with long practiſe of prayer. More ouer Gregory was not ſtirred vp to
ſuch workes by remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or feare of hell, for God allwaies
guided him by way of loue: and what greater ſigne can there be of his long
and ſetled vertue, and firme loue, then to come to the Indies, and goe
through the places of greateſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were Mexico and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catecas, the
country being in the greateſt proſperity for riches and

retire into a wildernes, that God might there giue ſpirituall increaſes in
his ſoule as he had done till that time, as he told me? the which there is no
doubt but they were very great, eſpecially in prayer: and ſince that the
diuine Maieſty, the very firſt day that he led him into the deſert, laid
vpon his shoulders one of the heauieſt burthens and hardeſt exerciſes,
that are in the ſpirituall life, as shall be ſaid in the Chapter following,
the weight of this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth this young mans vertue (ſince that God
laieth on burthens proportionable to ones ſtrength) the which being
ordinarily wont to be gotten by ſucceſſe of time and holy exerciſes, we
may eaſily vnderſtand that he had ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoſe twelue yeares wherin he
had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed the vſe of reaſon in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue by meanes of prayer and

ſucceed well with him, according to that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the holy Ghoſt,
which was ofte in his mouth: It will goe well with that man that shall cary the
yoake of God from his youth.</p>
               <p>He did not tell me in particular, the exerciſes of prayer
which he vſed in his firſt yeares, for, as we ſaid, he neuer told thinges
concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf vnles there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable occaſion of profiting his
neighbour; but as for my ſelf, I haue allwaies beleeued that the ground and
beginning of this his courſe was our Sauiour Chriſt, for he outght to be
the entrance of thoſe that begin well, and we haue heard from him ſuch good
medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vpon our holy faith, and vpon the life, and death of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
eſpecially of his infancy and childhood, with ſuch deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſpirit
as shewed plainly his long vſe and practiſe in that kind of meditation: in

ones of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and eſpecially of the ſacred Virgin Mary, and
he counſailed thoſe that deſired to profit in the ſpirituall way to
ſay their beades ouer with deuotion, to her honour, as being the refuge and
ſafegard of ſinners, and to perſeuer in that holy exerciſe, and
eſteeme it as their honour, to be denout Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to that great

               <p>GRegory went out into the field, as he was vſed to call it, of
the wildernes, being one or two months vnder one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares of age, as

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:5694:134"/>thing certainely, for he could not conceale all from me,
for the ſpace of eighteen yeares which I I ſpent in his company.</p>
               <p>The firſt prayer which he vſed there, were thoſe famous
wordes, O Lord, be hold I goe forth only to ſerue thee not for any intereſt

wordes, but offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to the Eternall Father in thoſe few,
makeing himſelf his ſlaue, ſo as that all his labours and gaines should
be for his Lord, and this he meant by (not for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of mine) for he
deſired in all his workes, to ſeeke only the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. The Allmighty
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his offering made with ſuch a willing mind, and the diuine
wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vndertooke the charge to be Gregory his Maſter, teaching him that
which was conuenient. <hi>Fiat voluntas tua ſicut in caelo &amp; in terra
Amen Ieſus;</hi> teaching him the ſame prayer that he had taught 
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:5694:135"/>his Apoſtles and in this prayer he gaue him for his
exerciſe, one of the moſt excellent workes, and hardeſt to be done,
becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the doctrine of the conformity of our will with
that of God, which ſpirituall men call reſignation, and that not in any
degree whatſoeuer, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which thoſe wordes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
namely that there be ſuch conformity vpon earth with the will of God, as is
talked of and practiſed in heauen.</p>
               <p>It is much to be noted, that the diuine goodnes would haue
Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory practiſe himſelf ſo long in this exerciſe, as our Sauiour
Chriſt was in preaching his ghoſpell, to giue vs therby to vnderſtand,
that all the perfection of his holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine conſiſteth in the perfect
exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thoſe wordes.</p>
               <p>The carefull and ſtudious ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler embraced this diuine
prayer and leſſon with ſuch good will and reſolution, as that for 3.
yeares <pb n="261" facs="tcp:5694:135"/>together, a wonderfull thing: without ceaſing or

often he ſaid thoſe wordes: <hi>Fiat voluntas tuaſicut in caelo &amp; in

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m with a multitude of temptations, ſo that, as he told me, in
thoſe times, by reaſon of the many temptations that came vpon him, he could
not poſſible take any booke in hand, and that <pb n="262" facs="tcp:5694:136"/>thoſe
only wordes ſerued him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of bookes and ſtudy, and with them, as
with armour of proofe, he defended himſelf from all his enemies and ouercame
them; and becauſe he had found by experience the great force and vertue of
thoſe wordes, he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failed many perſons to repeate them often with
deuotion.</p>
               <p>During thoſe breathings, his operations were ſo vehement as
that he was allmoſt allwaies ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated and thought of nothing of this world,
and ſuch was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiuenes, wherwith he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his memory,
vnderſtanding, and will in this diuine exerciſe, that allthough, while he
was in it, he was aſſailed with many grieuous temptations, yet as ſoone
as they were paſt, he did not remember them. From this exerciſe of
reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, as from a ſolid roote grew out all his wiſedome and
ſpirit.</p>
               <p>When he had exerciſed himſelf <pb n="263" facs="tcp:5694:136"/>for the
ſpace of three yeares in this ſpirit of reſignation, it pleaſed his
heauenly Maſter to aduance him to another degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
inſtructing him inwardly that the height of perfection in this life was in
the practiſe of theſe wordes: Thou shalt loue God with all thy heart, and
with all thy ſoule, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength, and
thy neighbour as thy ſelf; and that he was allwaies to practiſe this,
vſing all his forces in it, louing God and his neighbour with one act of
loue, imitaring herein God himſelf; therfore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes he did not repeate
ſo often as before, that act of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, wherin he ſaid <hi>Fiat
vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas tua ſicut in coelo &amp; in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Amen Ieſus;</hi> becauſe
this often making of acts would rather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then further the continuall act
of loue wherin his ſoule now was, as he himſelf ſaid. For the ſame
reaſon he left of other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <pb n="264" facs="tcp:5694:137"/>and exerciſes
which he vſed before, becauſe they should not diuert him from his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall act of loue. Gregory endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to follow this exerciſe with the
ſame fortitude as he had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that of reſignation, yea and with
greater, for row his ſtrength was increaſed; So in few yeares he became
ſo expert a louer, as that he told me that it ſeemed vnto him a very hard
thing to leaue off that diuine exerciſe of loue euen for a short time, and
that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without breaking it off he did eate and talke, and performe all
other operations both of body and mind.</p>
               <p>Together with this heauenly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, he began to reade the
bible, and moſt of all at this time, for it hapned ſometimes, that he
ſpent three or foure howers in the day in reading of it, and by this great
loue towardes God he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the vnderſtanding of the Scripture. Hereby
he got that <pb n="265" facs="tcp:5694:137"/>great poiſe and meaſure in his wordes,
the greate prudence and wiſedome he shewed in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and counſails,
and the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in louing his neighbour and himſelf wherin he did much
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, for in all his good workes, he eſteemed himſelf as one of the
reſt of the world, and deſired as much to obtaine mercy for them as for
himſelf. From hence allſo proceeded his purity of mind in prayer freedome
and Dominion againſt his enemies, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere mortification of his
ſenſes. Now in praying he did not vſe ſuch violence and force as he did
before, but a more refined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate act, leſſe ſenſible, but
more prefect. In this manner he went on euery day increaſing in perfection
and that after ſuch a manner as that many ſpirituall men were deceiued,
ſeing him ſo conuerſant in other arts and ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, it ſeeming vnto
them, that this would diuert him from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <pb n="266" facs="tcp:5694:138"/>but he
was ſo far from that as that in his laſt yeares he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch high
degree, that as he hath often told me his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour man did worke without
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting any thing to the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and that he did not reduce the
conference that he had with God into mentall wordes but to another language
which should ſeeme to haue excellent effects. To conclude, by meanes of this
exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe he attained vnto that excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnion with God, which he all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
endeauoured to practiſe, and his heroicall vertues, and to ſay all in a
word; together with this, there came to him all that is good.</p>

which Gregory Lopes gaue vpon certaine occaſions to the end that by them his
ſpirit might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more appeare, which ſince that it was ſo
interiour, may be the better knowne out of theſe.</p>
               <p>A certaine religious man both ſpirituall and learned (one whom
Gregory well eſteemed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with more then with any other) asked
him, if he had any particular times and howres of the day, or night appointed
to make his act of loue more inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, if peraduenture it grew ſlack or cold
whileſt he was at table, or otherwiſe emploied in offices of 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:5694:139"/>charity towardes his neighbour, or for the comfort of
thoſe that conferred with him? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he had no ſet times,
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he had need of any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was not any created thing
that did hinder him, or make him grow remiſſe, that his inward operation
was allwaies in the ſame eſtate, that it was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt become naturall,
that he had neuer gone back in the perfection of the vnion which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him, but that he allwaies went forwardes, and that by meanes of this vnion he
had got whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he knew, becauſe God had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bin his Maſter,
not bookes, though, it was a great comfort to him, to ſee thoſe thinges
writen by Tauler and Rusbroque which God had imparted to him, and he neuer
ceaſed to praiſe and extoll the ſpirite of the holy Mother Terreſa de
Ieſus.</p>
               <p>At another time being asked by the ſame religious man: ſir
if you <pb n="269" facs="tcp:5694:139"/>were a Prieſt what would you doe? he made
anſwer: as I doe now; he replied: how would you haue prepared, you ſelf to
ſay Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe? he ſaid, as I prepare myſelf now; he asked him further:
and how would you haue made your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentos, he anſwered him; after the ſame
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as I doe allwaies; and he added moreouer ſaying: if I were certaine to
dy within theſe few howers, I should not doe any thing more then I doe, for I
am now actually giuing vnto God all that I haue, and I cannot giue him more,
vnles he out of his mercy giue it me.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it often falleth out, that as the ſoule is
louing God, with all her ſtrength in great quietnes, our Lord ſodainly
raiſeth her vp for a short time to the height of vnion, drawing as it were
the curtaine which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and her, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dilating her, and
making her capable of ſuch thinges as she can <pb n="270" facs="tcp:5694:140"/>neither
expreſſe nor conceiue, and when she deſireth to thinke and ſtay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that which God wrought in her, she findeth that thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours are now
paſt, the affections of them only remaining behind; the ſaid religious man
asked him againe, whether hauing receiued ſuch fauours, he remembred them
afterwardes, and whether his ſoule did allwaies remaine in that height, to
which God is wont to raiſe others for a little time, as is ſaid? he
anſwered him; that as it is not in mans power to obtaine ſuch ſingular
fauours of God, ſo neither is it in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member or continue them
for a long time, and that he doubted whether there euer had bin any pure
creature, except the B. Virgin, that did allwaies perſeuer in ſuch an
excellent vnion which God is wont to giue, though in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kind of
vnion (ſuch as God had giuen vnto him) one might allwaies continue and
profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:5694:140"/>And proſecuting this matter he ſaid
further, that vnions, reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, extaſies, and rapts were not the top of
perfection, nor that it did not conſiſt in them, though God is often wont
to giue them, becauſe he worketh with euery ſoule according to her
capacity, neceſſity, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they that are perfect and well
exerciſed in the act of loue, doe not require that the ſenſes should be
ſuſpended from their operation, to the end that they may be more vnited
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God becauſe the ſenſes are no hindrance to them in their enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, for he had neuer had any extaſy, reuelation, or rapt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prined him
of his ſenſes, the which had neuer hindred him.</p>
               <p>At another time the ſame man talked with him of ſome
ſoules which attained to great peace and

                  </gap>aſſiue vnion, and, as it were,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying loue, which God gaue vnto them; Gregory anſwered him that 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:5694:141"/>ſuch as thoſe were good ſoules and were in a good
way, but that perfection and merit is not ſo much in thoſe workes of
enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in that the ſoule of her part endeauoureth with all her might to
loue God with the perfecteſt manner and act that she can; for this is rather
to doe then to enioy, and the other is rather enioying, then working, becauſe
the ſoule that loueth God perfectly, cannot giue him more then she doth giue
him, neither doth God require any thing elſe of her, for hereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
all our law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>I was once talking with him how gratious in the ſight of God
certaine perſons were who doe allwaies employ themſelues in praying for the
whole Church with a great zeale of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and deſire of the ſaluation
of ſoules; he ſaid that this was a great perfection but ſuch as few had
attained vnto, and that he had <pb n="273" facs="tcp:5694:141"/>vnderſtood that Mother
Iſabell de la Natiuidad, a nunne of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of the Conception in
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xico, now deceaſed, had obtained it, who as I thinke for certaine knew by
reuelation from God, that Gregory Lopes allso was wholly giuen to this
exerciſe; for in a letter which she writ, she ſaid theſe wordes: I am
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in the office which God hath put me in of praying for the whole
Church, as my brother allſo doth; she ſaid this by Gregory, and she was one
free from all falshood and euen from ſuſpicion. Thinges haue bin ſaid in
this Chapter, which in the opinion of thoſe that treat of prayer and
ſpirit, are for confirmation and teſtimony of great ſanctity, more then

they ſee their pray that they may ſee it on their Maſters table, and he
did not only offer vp in ſacrifice vnto God, the victories and the ſpoiles
of his combates, but alſo the gifts and ſtrength wherwith God did enrich
and adorne him, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an offering of them vnto his God and giuer with a very
hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayer and, acknowledgment, wherin he confeſſed him to be the
chiefe good and ſource of all good, and therfore moſt worthy, to whom all
thinges which we haue receiued should be offered, ſo that Gregory as ſoone
as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any fauour or gift, preſently with a more cleare knowledge
and feruent charity directed it to his Lord, without ſtaying on it himſelf,
becauſe he deſired all whatſoeuer he receiued, should be his. Such was
his fidelity and loue <pb n="276" facs="tcp:5694:143"/>towardes God; and in theſe times
he was vſed to repeate that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the wiſe man: you shall find
many mercifull but a faith, full man who will find?</p>
               <p>He was allſo wont to offer vp vnto the Eternall Father the
life, Paſſion and death of Ieſus Chriſt, his ſon and our Redeemer.
This offering, ſometimes he made for the whole world, othertimes for
particular perſons, or intentions, according as he vnderſtood that it was
the will of God; he made ſuch account of this Sacrifice or ſpirituall
Maſſe, that one day tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with me about it, he told me that God had
thouſands of prieſts in the world, who made this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſpiritually
many times in the day and that he did frequent two kinds of ſpirituall
commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions both conſiſting in ardent deſires, the one of receiuing
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally our Sauiour Chriſt, the other, of receiuing within himſelf
the Father, the ſon and <pb n="277" facs="tcp:5694:143"/>and holy Ghoſt, making
himſelf a liuing and pure temple of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, and giuing it
actually entertainment in his heart, where it might come and allwaies
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
               <p>I asked him one day how he did exerciſe the loue of God and
his neighbour; he anſwered me, that he onely repeated ſome verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of
Dauid, ſuch as theſe: Praiſe yee our lord all nations, praiſe yee him
all people; All the workes of our lord, bleſſe yee our lord, praiſe yee
him and glorify yee him for euer. Let all the earth o Lord adore thee and
bleſſe thee. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I remained not onely ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but allſo well
affected to that manner of praving which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſo much in it.</p>
               <p>He was allſo very carefull to pray for our holy Mother the
Church, for her increaſe, and for the exaltation of our holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith
throughout all kindo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es. He did
pray very carneſtly <pb n="278" facs="tcp:5694:144"/>for thoſe that were in ſin, and
he ſaid that this prayer was very pleaſing vnto God, relating vpon this
occaſion that which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt our Sauiour and ſaint Catherine
of Siena, who pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him inſtantly for thoſe that are in mortall
ſin, heard from his diuine mouth: I intreat thee to pray vnto me for them;
and he was wont to repeate thoſe wordes with much tendernes and
commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, when there was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to talke of thoſe that are in
ſin.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe he related an exemple, which ſaint
Denys the Areopagite in his eighth Epiſtle to Demophilus affirmeth that he
had heard from the mouth of ſaint Carpus the Bishop, to whom by reaſon of
his cleanenes and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart God reuealed many thinges; and it was
this: the ſaid ſaint Carpus vnderſtanding for certaine that an idolater
had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted a Chriſtian and made him <pb n="279" facs="tcp:5694:144"/>forſake his
faith, was ſo incenſed againſt both, as that he inſtantly beſought
God to take them away from the face of the earth, not being able to endure that
ſuch wicked men should liue vpon it, ſince that they peruerted the way of
God; and looking vp towardes heauen he ſaw therin Ieſus Chriſt ſitting
enuironned with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Angells and ſaints, then looking downe into the
earth as it were by the mouth of a well, he ſaw hell and its tourments, and
in the very brinke of the well were thoſe two wicked men, whom he had
curſed, ſtaggering and ready to fall, and trembling in pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner,
becauſe thoſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish ſerpents ſought to catch hold and pull them in.
Carpus was told, that he would doe well to pray for them, that they might be
freed from thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous paines, but he would not, yea he prayed vnto God
to let them fall into that well, and lifting vp <pb n="280" facs="tcp:5694:145"/>his eies
againe towardes heauen, he ſaw the moſt mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

allſo to help them, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Carpus ſaid vnto him: oh Carpus I am

ſight of God and the company of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and ſaints. He made vſe of
ſuch examples to practiſe himſelf and teach others the ſpirit of
Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He did amorouſly and earneſtly importune God in his prayers
to draw vnto him all countries and nations, couerting them, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them
enter into the lap of the Church, and to reduce the Iewes and heretikes to the
holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith. This he did without eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deſiſting from that act of loueing God which we ſpoke
of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:5694:145"/>The chiefe ſcope of his prayer for his
neighbours, was that the will of God might be fullfilled in them on earth as it
is in heauen, and he tooke occaſion from all thinges to make that prayer. If
he heard men ſay how the king for his great power and iuſtice was feared
and reuerenced, and that he enioyed his kingdome in peace, he preſently
turned to God and ſaid: thou art allmighty a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iuſt ô Lord, let all
feare thee, and reuerence thee; and poſſeſſe ô Lord all this thy
kingdome in peace.</p>
               <p>When he heard that a father for his goodnes was loued by his
ſons, he preſently ſaid vnto God: ô Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fountaine of all
good, let all thy ſons loue thee. When he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how a gardiner
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to make all his trees yeeld fruit, he preſently turned to the
Creatour of all, ſaying: let none of thy creatures be loſt, oh Lord, let
them yeeld their fruit in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſon. When he heard of great 
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:5694:146"/>warres and shedding of bloud, he lifted vp his heart vnto
God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: your ſons and my brethren, whom you command me ſo much to
loue, behold ô Father how they behaue themſelues; and to ſay in
briefe, all the goods and euills of the world were vnto him motiues of
prayer.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he told me that he ſaw in God all whatſoeuet was
in the world, as it were, gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one point, without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
the which it might be was by ſome great light of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he
receiued in certaine occaſions, wherby we may gather ſomething of the
excellence of his prayer, and how eleuated his ſoule was and like vnto God,
ſince that he had the whole world abridged in his vnderſtanding, and with
ſuch particular light reduced to an vnity, that he might offer it vnto
God.</p>
               <p>He deſired much that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours should neuer ceaſe to
pray <pb n="283" facs="tcp:5694:146"/>vnto God euen in their exteriour workes; becauſe,
as one well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, he knew the great good that it containes, and he was
wont to praiſe the Machabes for that vertue, who in their greateſt
bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, as is related in their hiſtory, did at the ſame time fight with
their handes, and pray in their hearts.</p>
               <p>He vſed another manner of praying worthy the learning and
imitating, for whenſoeuer he was to ſpeake anſwer or aske any thing; he
firſt fixed his mind on God by mentall prayer, imploring his diuine
aſſiſtance. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to tell that which befell
Nehemias with Artaxerzes, as is written in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the
ſecond of Eſdras; for this great Monarch asking of Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias his cup
bearer, what it was that he deſired, the text ſaith; that before he began
to ſpeake he made his prayer vnto the God of heauen, wherby he obtained of
the king <pb n="284" facs="tcp:5694:147"/>all whatſoeuer he asked.</p>
               <p>He was much deuoted to the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> becauſe it
was taught him by our Sauiour, and he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped much profit by it: in moſt of
the Petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he put in thoſe wordes. As in heauen ſo vpon earth; as when
he ſaid: Hallowed be thy name, he added: as in heauen, ſo on earth; for
hereby he shewed the deſire that he had of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and all though many
ſeruants of God, to induce men to good, and draw them to the ſeruice of
God, doe write letters and take in hand great iourneyes, and doe other thinges,
yet Gregory inſteed of theſe, when he deſired to help his neighbours and
relieue their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, had preſently recourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by his
prayers, knowing that all good was to proceed from him; and by this meanes he
wrought admirable effects; and vpon this occaſion he would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tell
merit is far better nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating with God then with Men. <pb n="285" facs="tcp:5694:147"/>But to thoſe that asked him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile by word or writing, he
gaue anſwer according as he thought was neceſſary for their good and God
his honour, to whom he gaue thankes, becauſe he had perſonages in his
Church that did allſo aſſiſt their neighbours by ſuch outward
meanes.</p>

ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Gregory did liue in God, becauſe I was allwaies in hope of a
greater light from his diuine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that I might be better able to declare
a thing of ſuch importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. This manner was not by extaſies or rapts,
becauſe his vnion ſeemed allwaies vnto me, immediate ſince that his will
free form all other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections tended very ſtrongly one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:5694:148"/>vnto God; and this manner of vnion might be ſeen by its
great fruits that allwaies remained in him.</p>
               <p>This manſion, I thinke cannot be otherwiſe tearmed better
then a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformation into God, becauſe the ſoule in this eſtate is
wholly beſides herſelf, and wholly in God, according to that of the
Apoſtle, I liue, but now not I, becauſe Chriſt liueth in me. And thus the
matter is, for vnto vs that haue looked into his life and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he
allwaies ſeemed a pour-trait of Chriſt, and therfore we called him, a man
truely crucified into the world, for he onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the ſpirituall life,
of which when ſpirituall perſons did talke with him, he inuited them to
this transformation ſaying vnto them thoſe wordes of S. Iohn: God gaue them
power to be made ſons of God to thoſe that beleeue in his name, who now are
not borne of flesh and bloud nor of the will of <pb n="287" facs="tcp:5694:148"/>man; but
God himſelf; and I am certaine that this transformation of Gregory into God,
was well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of by all the ſpirituall men that conuerſed with him.</p>
               <p>In this transformation, which I call immediate vnion, there
vſeth to be a great ſpirituall ioy which is called fruition; becauſe
thoſe that are ſo transformed, for a long time are rather in ioy then
paine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are caried by God, without any labour of theirs, to that
moſt happy ſtate; and this is that which is called the ſpirituall oile;
there they are with God as it were onely paſſiuely, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d I call it ſo
becauſe, allthough it be true that the ſoule in that vnion be allwaies in
actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet not ſo much inſeeking after as in poſſeſſing, for she
rather exerciſeth the act of poſſeſſing and enioying, then the act of
deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>I doe not know whether Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had this as it were paſſiue
vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from the time that he went into <pb n="288" facs="tcp:5694:149"/>the deſert, for
God did in ſuch manner communicate himſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as that he euery day
deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more, and therfore did not ſo much entertaine himſelf in
enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was giuen him, as with new deſires to ſee himſelf
euery day approch nearer vnto God.</p>
               <p>S. Denys the Areopagite ſaith, that Hierotheus his Maſter
had the ſtate of ſpirituall reſt and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we haue ſpoken of
and he putteth it downe for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection that is in this life, and
all the contemplatiues are of the ſame opinion, and this is the only
reaſon, why the ſurname of Diuine was giuen to Hierotheus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this
vnion maketh the ſoule to be the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with God and very like the
diuine nature, the which doth not exerciſe its operations with paine and
toile but ioy. I haue told vpon diuerſe occaſions this ſo common opinion
vnto Gregory, fifteen yeares before his death; <pb n="289" facs="tcp:5694:149"/>and though
he yeelded allſo to it (for he knew it very well) yet he eſteemed it was
better for himſelf to be in action, and allwaies louing God and his
neighbour, labouring therein both day and night. And therfore he embraced this
eſtate the more willingly, for he ſaid that God had giuen him that
exerciſe as being the beſt, and that he was to endeauour with all his
ſtrength, not to leaue it off for any ioy or fruition whatſoeuer; for he
could not conceiue, how in this life that should be moſt perfect, which had

for wiſe men to determine, and will proſecute my intent.</p>
               <p>Gregory his transformation into Chriſt, which I perceiued in
him, was an ardent loue and deſire to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollow him in his life and imitate
his labours and Croſſe, for it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the moſt holy life of
our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was a <pb n="290" facs="tcp:5694:150"/>liuely patterne for vs
all to imitate, in fullfilling the will of his eternall father, and ſo he
ſaith: I came not to doe my will, but my fathers: and in another place: it be
hooueth me to doe the worke of him that ſent me, while it is day.</p>
               <p>It is allſo well knowne, that the life of our Sauiour Chriſt
from his birth till his death was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall bearing of the croſſe of our
ſinnes, working therby our redemption ſo as all his life was a ſuffering
of troubles; in theſe therfore Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory deſired, and allſo did imitate
Chriſt; wherfore in his life there was but little fruition and ioy, and much
care and trouble, ſo as it ſeemes that this want of ſenſible ioyes may
be eſteemed a priuiledge and particular guift of God, ſince that without
theſe fauours, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie beſtowed vpon him that which he is
wont to giue to others that haue them, as may be ſeen in the knowledge,
wiſedome fortitude, perſeueance, and all the <pb n="291" facs="tcp:5694:150"/>other
diuine gifts wher with he was endued. Hereby allſo it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that
God directed him in waies proper to men; for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty doth for the
moſt part giue thoſe ioyes to his friends in the beginning of their
conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they begin to dy to the world and liue in God, then he
bringeth them into his cellar, to giue them a taſt: then he giueth them
ſome light and ioy as a pledge, or earneſt of that which is in heauen, to
make them walke on with ſtrength and perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; but after they haue
profited and are growne ſtrong, he inuiteth them to the higheſt degree of
charity, which is to ſuffer and dy for their beloued; we haue examples of
both in the holy Apoſtles: and whoſoeuer shall haue read with attention
that which is aboue written, will allſo come to ſee, that this exerciſe
of greateſt charity, which maketh one ſuffer and dy for his beloued, was
the whole life <pb n="292" facs="tcp:5694:151"/>of this holy man, for it was a thing well
knowne to vs all that did conuerſe with him, that this ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement an
exerciſe of louing God with all his ſtrength, was the cauſe of all his
weakneſſes, paines and ſickneſſes, and he perceiuing this, went on
pining away ioyfully for his beloued. Vpon this ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, relating

in heauen ſpirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs in a very high degree. He did tell the liues of

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours <pb n="293" facs="tcp:5694:151"/>ſaid vnto them: we hermits vſe to endure
theſe torments in the deſert. But becauſe it is a thing moſt certain
both to me and to others that knew Gregory, that he did excell in ſpirituall
martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I will not ſpeake more hereof conſidering the ioy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he
receiued his death, when without any feare he beheld it neare at hand, yea with
far more contentment then wordly men feele in the middeſt of their
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, honours and paſtimes, ſaying with the Apoſtle, to mee
Chriſt is life and death againe.</p>
               <p>Gregory his delight therfore was to ſuffer for Chriſt, and
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent and glory was in the croſſe, ſaying with S. Paul: Far be it
from me to glory in any thing but in the croſſe of my Sauiour. Ieſus
Chriſt; and with the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid who ſeing himſelf ſo enriched with
the benefits and fauours which God had beſtowed vpon him in his laſt daies,
he began to <pb n="294" facs="tcp:5694:152"/>conſider it and to ſay: what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
shall I make vnto God for all the fauours that he hath done me? and fixing his
eies vpon all whatſoeuer he had, he found no other recompence but only to
ſay: I will take his cup and call vpon his name, as if he should ſay: I wil
deſire inwardly to drinke of the cup of his Paſſion, the which I ſee
and know well by the ſpirit of Propheſy. This therfore was the ſpirit of
Gregory, in this way God did guide him, this is the doctrine which was taught
him by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, in whoſe paines and death he found ſuch
ſpirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that he neuer deſired any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is ſaid; and he
was wont to ſay, that perfect ſpirituall men are diſpleaſed with
thoſe delights which beginners doe willingly embrace, for a man taketh as a
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to be offered a bunch of grapes or an apple wherwith the child is
much taken; he added mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer, that this preſent life is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:5694:152"/>for ioy and
reſt, but ſorrow and trouble.</p>
               <p>Finally this his refuſing, euen of ſpirituall delights,
proceeded from a perfect pouerty of ſpirit which was giuen him by God,
wherunto appertaineth, to deſire nothing but God for his owne ſake, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
conſiſteth true charity, and the top of Chriſtian perfection; ſo as he
that loueth God moſt, is moſt perfect, be it with thoſe delights or no,
for if the cobler mending his shooes should loue God more then a contemplatiue
man, he would be more perfect in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life then he, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the fruition that he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>With this ſpirit, did Gregory chieflly attend to the
increaſe and purity of charity, deſiring allwaies, in his life and labours
to imitate our Sauiour Chriſt, whom he all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies looked vpon as on a good

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:5694:153"/>with Dauid: my eies are allwaies vpon our lord: and to
this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he was wont wiſely to vſe that ſentence: the wiſe mans
eies are in his head, meaning that the wiſe man hath his eies allwaies vpon
Chriſt who is his head; for ſaid he the ſoule touched with the loue of
God, is like the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners needle, which by reaſon that it is touched with a
loade-ſtone, allwaies inclineth to the north; and that ſpirituall men ought
to haue this maruailous property, as in what place or buſines ſoeuer they
are, to be allwaies inclined, and deſire to haue their eies all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fixed
on our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He tooke great contentment to ſee men doe ſo; for once four
men, very ſpirituall, and great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God; being come to viſit him
and ſitting with him at the table, it ſo fell out, that they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for that all we that ſit a <pb n="297" facs="tcp:5694:153"/>this table, haue our head
bare. He ſpoke ſpiritually, and his meaning was, that they were all
ſpiritually looking vpon Chriſt, who is our head, and at that time was bare
vnto them all: and by reaſon of the tokens that we ſaw, I hold for
certaine, that he ſaw the hearts of thoſe that were preſent, for, as is
ſaid, God hath oftentimes done him that fauour, and conſidering the vertue
and good ſpirit of thoſe his gueſts, it may be thought that they were in
that diſpoſition, as to haue their eies vpon God. This holy man, as I was
allwaies of opinion, neuer loſt ſight of God, and therfore God neuer went
out of ſight from him, according to to that of Iob: God will neuer haue his
eies off of the iuſt man, and by meanes of this ſight, God allwaies
preſerued him in ſuch manner from falling into all the nets and ſnares
whatſoeuer the enemy laied for him, as that he paſſed through them freely
and ſafely, as is shewed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I haue allwaies thought, that God hath wrought ſtranges
effects through his prayers; and though he out of his humility neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
any of thoſe great effects for he neuer told me any in that kind though I was
ſo familiary with him, yet I am certaine; that he knew of wonderfull thinges
which God had done by his prayers, of the which I will here relate for the
greater glory of God, ſome, which I came to know by other meanes,</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1579. being at our Ladies of Remedies he was
viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a prieſt, who was much troubled in mind, becauſe he did not
perſeuer in the ſeruice of God, but fell into great in conueniences through
ſuch occaſions as offered themſelues. Therfore he inſtantly 
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:5694:154"/>beſought him to pray for him, and to aduiſe him what
he should doe, for aſſuredly he would doe it whatſoeuer it were, though
it were to goe vnto a montaine and be an hermite, ſince that his ſaluation
was not a buſines of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Hereunto Gregory anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only
theſe wordes: you shall be an hermite in Mexico for this yeare. He
vnderſtanding it as it ought to be vnderſtood, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to change his
life, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with much profit of his ſoule. This prieſt therfore
walking through he ſtreetes of Mexico (for he emploied himſelf in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
of charity towardes his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hour) had an inward calling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting
at that time on that which the holy man had ſaid vnto him, yet his calling
was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable thereunto, which was that he should obſerue inward
recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and at the ſame inſtant there was giuen him, through the
diuine mercy, ſuch courage and <pb n="300" facs="tcp:5694:155"/>ſtrength, as that he
walked through all the ſtreetes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick places, inwardly recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and praying, in ſuch ſort, as that no buſines, hinderance or noiſe was
of force to diuert him from that exerciſe, as if he had bin fifty yeares
exerciſed in prayer. He became a new Man, and ſo different from what he
was, as that at that very inſtant, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his thoughts from the earth,
and fixed them on heauen. He left off all complements and viſits (for this it
was that did enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage him) and all his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delight was to be
recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in mind, and treating with God of his ſaluation. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to walke ſolitary, if charity did not otherwiſe require; the people were no
more hindrance to him, then if they had bin tres, or craggs of a montaine; he
began to vſe faſtings, diſciplines, haire-shirts and God exerciſed him
with greater temptations, then euer he <pb n="301" facs="tcp:5694:155"/>had in all his
life time before, ſome of them were inward, others out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and withall he
gaue him ſtrength to defend himſelf, as if he had bin an old beaten
ſouldier or ancient hermite. He began all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to liue in pouerty, and,
through Gregory his prayers, God framed in him the heremiticall life ſo
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and perfectly, as if he had ſpent many yeares in the deſert; and
leaſt there should be wanting vnto him any of thoſe thinges that are wont
to happen vnto her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, he was allmoſt all that yeare tempted viſibly by
the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells. The yeare exprired, he went to talke with Gregory who was then in
Guaſteca; he gaue him an account of his life, as he had done at other times
at our Ladies of Remedies, and haueing bin eight daies in his company, he
ſayd vnto him; now the yeare is paſt wherin I was to be an her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, what
muſt I doe from hence forwards, he anſwered only theſe 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:5694:156"/>wordes: Loue God and your neighbour, and herewith they
parted. The prieſt therfore taking his iourney towardes Mexico and being come
to an vnhabited place which is in the way, began to thinke vpon thoſe wordes,
and becauſe he had ſtudied the tract of Charity, he thought he knew that
allready, and herewith he went on with little mind to that exerciſe to which
new as counſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but, then remembring himſelf, how much good Gregory his
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aduiſe had done him, he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to humble himſelf, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that
thoſe wordes might haue ſome deeper miſterie then that which he
vnderſtood; he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to pray for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, and to
beſeech God to shew vnto him that which lay hidden vnder thoſe wordes, and
not to haue regard to his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and pride; and preſently he heard God
ſpeake inwardly vnto him very diſtinctly, ſaying: <pb n="303" facs="tcp:5694:156"/>if thou deſireſt to loue God, thou muſt ſtrip thy ſelf out
of thy ſelf and all whatſoeuer thou haſt, and be dead to all worldly
thinges. He offered himſelf with all his heart herunto, that he might receiue
that fauour from the Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty; preſently found in himſelf, that
nakednes, which God did require, and withall was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and bathed in the
ointment of the loue of God, which was ſo great that neither his
vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was able to comprehend it, nor his heart to receiue it, ſo
as he did euen melt away into this great gift. Hereby the prieſt
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the depth and perfection of Gregory his counſaile, and the
efficacy of his prayer. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to cleanſe his heart, that he might
receiue that fauour, and made firme purpoſes to follow the hand and will of
God which way ſoeuer he was pleaſed to lead him. This act of loue dured for
the ſpace of ſeauen howers, God <pb n="304" facs="tcp:5694:157"/>shewed him the
vertues and their beauty, and made him haue a triall of them, as it were euen
touching and poſſeſſing them. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him, after this
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, a great affection, which was ſuch as that for ſix yeares ſpace,
he continued in this ſame loue, being allmoſt allwaies in actuall
exerciſe of it, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe vertues which God had taught him;
and euen till this day, which is now more then thirty yeares, it hath bin his
prop and ſtaffe in all his tribulations and troubles, perſeuering
couragiously in the way of God. And he hath receiued many other fauours, which
I will not here relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this alone is ſufficient to shew, how
pleaſing this holy man his prayers were in the ſight of God, euen whileſt
he liued in this exile.</p>
               <p>A certaine perſon intreating Gregory very earneſtly to
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to direct him in the ſpirituall way, <pb n="305" facs="tcp:5694:157"/>he
anſwered him: goe brother for Ieſus Chriſt is your Maſter, and he
preſently found the truth hereof in his ſoule, and perceiued it in his
workes, for he began to proceed with ſuch difference in his ſpirit, as
there is, betwixt ſeing, and being blind; afterwardes God gaue him the
knowledge of his owne being nothing, and of Ieſus Chriſt his truth ſo
clearely, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came another man, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this great good had

               <p>A religious woman of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſpirit, receiued an
inward warning that a great misfortune would befall her. She was much troubled
hereat for the ſpace of eight months, fearing leaſt that this misfortune
were ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God, and therfore she recommended herſelf to the 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:5694:158"/>prayers of all the ſeruants of God. This religious
woman hauing communicated vpon the feaſt of our Ladies Natiuity, had a
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſpiration whileſt she was at her prayers, to intreat Gregory
Lopes, who was then in Santafe, to pray for her. She intreated a gentleman,
that came to viſit her, and now is a religious Man, to goe and deſire him
to recommend her vnto God. The holy man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the meſſage, anſwered
him: I will doe ſo, let her truſt in God and feare nothing, for she shall
not offend him. Herewith she became as quiet in mind, as if she had bin told
ſo by an Angell from heauen; and ſo it fell out as Gregory had ſaid, but
this gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman, going to Santafe to carry the meſſage, by the way went
into the Conuent of ſaint Dominick of Mexico, to intreat a certaine
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man of great ſanctity to pray for this religious woman his
ghoſtly child. The day following <pb n="307" facs="tcp:5694:158"/>the ſaid religious
man being at his prayers, was rapt in ſpirit, and ſaw holy Gregory kneeling
in the preſence of God and praying for her, and that his diuine Maieſty
accepted his prayers with much content; and told him that his ſeruant Gregory
was very mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her in his prayers. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man told this with
great feeling and many teares; and ſaid, that in that viſion he came to
know Gregory, for that before he did not know him; the religious woman became
thenceforward much deuoted to this holy man, who, at the day of his death,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requited her: for she, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, had for the ſpace of foure
daies together, a very ſpeciall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God his goodnes, and of
how much she was bound vnto him, and withall a diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the worlds
deceit; and she held as vndoubted, that she had receiued that fauour from God
by Gregory his meanes, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was a prieſt that was much addicted to this holy man,
and followed alltogether his counſaile and doctrine in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of
praying. He hauing allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receiued ſome fauours of God tooke ſuch
content in them as only to enioye them, he did not take any care to walke any
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſpirituall way; Gregory, ſeing his manner of proceeding:
recited that ſentence of Iſaias, thou haſt found life in thy hands,
therfore thou haſt not asked. Herewith God did much illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him, that
ſo he might walke with more pouerty of ſpirit, and caſt himſelf into
that infinite depth of God, without relying vpon his owne waies, nor euen vpon
thoſe fauours, wherwith at other times God had drawe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that he might be in more readines, vpon <pb n="309" facs="tcp:5694:159"/>all occaſions,
to accomplish the will of God and not to make any ſtop in the ſpirituall
way, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting herewith both himſelf and others.</p>
               <p>A young man very vertuous, and deſirous, to doe well, went
about very much diſquieted in mind, for the ſpace of foure or fiue months,
and the greateſt cauſe of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish was, becauſe he did not know, what
ſtate of life to make choice of for his owne ſaluation. He acquainted
herewith certain holy and deuout perſons, deſiring them to pray for him,
and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that none of theſe meanes was ſufficient to rid him of that
vnquietnes, he remembred himſelf of Gregory Lopes, and went to Santafe to
viſit him, and though he was a young man otherwiſe bold enough, yet at the
very ſight of Gregory, his heart was to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with feare and reuerence,
as that, allthough Gregory was of an humble demeanour a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in poore 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:5694:160"/>attire, he ſaid that he had neuer ſeen in his life a
man, that had ſtroken into him ſuch a reuerence, both inwardly and
outwardly, and that it ſeemed vnto him, that he ſaw in him the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance
of one more then a man. He intreated him to beſeech his diuine Maieſty to
giue him light, that he might chooſe the eſtate, wherin he should doe him
moſt ſeruice; and Gregory only ſaying vnto him: trouble not your ſelf,
for I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend you vnto God, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was quieted, and the ſaid
trouble neuer came to him againe, the which he attributed to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man his
prayer, and choſe the eſtate of Prieſthood, and died with an eſteeme of
vertue and ſanctity; he affirmed with an oath, that at other times he
acquainted Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with ſundry temptations that he had, and allwaies
returned with great ſatisfaction and comfort.</p>
               <p>Another perſon very deuout vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gregory, went vnto the place

anſwered: I did forget my ſelf laſt night, it shall not be ſo
